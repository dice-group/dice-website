This topic investigates the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer learning for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in low-resource languages. The research focuses on pre-training models on high-resource languages and fine-tuning them on limited annotated datasets of low-resource languages. Special attention is given to addressing the challenges of morphological complexity and data scarcity in these languages. The study builds upon existing research, such as [Wu and Dredze (2019)](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1077/), which demonstrated the effectiveness of mBERT in transferring knowledge to low-resource languages for NER tasks. Exploring techniques used in other sequence labeling tasks, such as [LOREM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3366423.3380252), for Named Entity Recognition (NER).

## Key research objectives include:

- Investigating state-of-the-art methods in cross-lingual NER
- Developing novel approaches for knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages
- Exploring innovative data augmentation techniques to generate labeled data for low-resource languages
- Implementing and evaluating transfer learning approaches to surpass existing benchmarks
- Investigating unsupervised and semi-supervised methods to improve training data availability

### Research Gaps

Limited exploration of unsupervised methods for cross-lingual NER: Most existing research on cross-lingual NER has focused on supervised methods, which require labeled data in the source language. There is a gap in understanding how unsupervised methods can be effectively used for cross-lingual NER in low-resource language 

### Tasks

- Investigate the state-of-the-art in cross-lingual NER
- Develop an approach for transferring knowledge from a model trained on high resource language to low resource language. 
- Data augmentation techniques for generating labeled data for low resource languages



### Prerequisites

- Basic NLP concepts
- Proficiency with Python Programming 
- Deep learning and Transfer learning concepts
