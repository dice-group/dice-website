# Topic 
A knowledge graph embedding (KGE) model assigns a unique embedding row for each unique entities/nodes and relations/edges.
As the size of the unique entities or relations grows, the memory usage of KGE increases.
Therefore, the memory requirement to train KGE model or deploy a trained model is bounded by the size of the data.

LLMs uses byte pair encoding techniques to learn to represent sequence of chars with subword unit.
Therefore, LLM embeddings are subword units, instead of unique words.
Recently, we show that byte pair encoding schema developed for LLMs can also be used for KGEs (see 
[Inference over Unseen Entities, Relations and Literals on Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06742) .
In this thesis, the student will design a byte pair encoding schema based on a given knowledge graph.
The student will closely work on [dice-embeddings](https://github.com/dice-group/dice-embeddings).
