For our tensor-based RDF Triple Store we developed a highly flexible data structure based on advanced C++ Meta programming. When running queries multiple times, operator tree can be reused. An additional performance gain can be expected, when taking statistics from a previous run and compile an operator tree. This way, the second run of a query benefits from a compiler optimizations in the operator tree.

The student will implement three parts:

* gather statistics from a run of a greedy just-in-time query planner
* generate code for a hard-coded operator tree
* compile and load the hard-coded operator tree and use it
* The student will evaluate costs and benefits of compiling with respect to overhead, speedup and scalability. The thesis includes a theoretical discussion of the data structure and query processing.

Requirement: solid modern C++11/14/17/20 skills
