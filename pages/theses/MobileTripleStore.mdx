In the DICE group, we develop [Tentris](https://github.com/dice-group/tentris), one of the fastest triple stores currently available. 

While triple stores are well established on desktop and server platforms, there are no production-ready triple stores available on mobile platforms. 

The objective of this thesis is to port Tentris to Android and/or iOS and evaluate its performance on ARM-based systems if possible against other triple stores. 

The master thesis includes:
* porting the tentris code to compile for Android and/or iOS
* write a simple wrapper app that allows us to load data, run a list of queries for benchmarking and run single queries.
* evaluate the loading performance, memory usage, and query performance (via the app).

Required skills: 
* Knowledge of Semantic Web Standards like SPARQL and RDF
* Good modern C++ coding skills (C++17/20)
* Experience with App development for Android and/or iOS
* Some experience with C++ template programming
