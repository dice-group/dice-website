Flexible data structures like tensors require flexible programming techniques like Templates and Meta Programming. For our tensorbased RDF Triple Store we developed a highly flexible data structure based on advanced C++ Meta programming.

The student will add further features to an existing implementation and evaluate the change with respect to speed, compression and scalability. The thesis includes a theoretical discussion of the data structure and the optimization approaches.
