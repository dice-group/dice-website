# Topic 
Most knowledge graphs are evolving over time.
Yet, most knowledge graph embedding models are designed to work on static knowledge graphs.

In this thesis, the student will focus on techniques that learn embeddings for different snapshots of KG.
[Stochastic Weight Average](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05407) and (Adaptive Stochastic Weight Averaging)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19092] techniques can be explored to learn embeddings in an efficient manner.

The student will closely work on [dice-embeddings](https://github.com/dice-group/dice-embeddings)
