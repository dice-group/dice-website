In the DICE group, we develop [Tentris](https://github.com/dice-group/tentris), one of the fastest triple stores currently availabe. 

Tentris is an in-memory triple store, i.e. all indices and data are held in the RAM rather than on the disc. 
While the in-memory nature of Tentris is crucial for its performance, it currently lacks the possibility to store and reload dataset between two runs. 

The objective of this thesis is to explore at least two serialization/deserialization strategies, evaluate them and discuss their pros and cons. 
Stragegies could involve:
* memory-mapped files
* custom serialization formats that are incrementally updateable
* synchronization mechanisms that have the implementation fo ACID guarantees in mind (implementing ACID guarantees is not part of the thesis)

The master thesis includes:
* develop and implement a two serialization strategies
* evaluate the two stragegies in different use-case settings
* discuss required extensions to give full ACID guarantees

Required skills: 
* knowledge of Semnatic Web Standards like SPARQL and RDF
* good modern C++ coding skills (C++17/20)
* experience with C++ template programming
