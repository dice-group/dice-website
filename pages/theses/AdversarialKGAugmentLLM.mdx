## Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human language. However, their performance can be significantly enhanced by integrating structured 
knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs). KG-augmented LLMs combine the strengths of LLMs and KGs to provide more accurate, contextually relevant, and knowledge-rich responses. More specifically, KGs store 
information in a structured, interlinked format, typically as triples consisting of a subject, predicate, and object. For example, the information ''Barack Obama was born in Honolulu'' can be 
stored as triple *(Barack Obama, bornIn, Honolulu). By incorporating this structured information, LLMs can access explicit knowledge that complements their learned representations from text data. 
KG-augmented LLM can solve many problems that standalone LLM cannot. Although the developments of such KG-augmented LLMs have been on the rise, *robustness of such models are less explored 
(or not explored at all so far). In this thesis, the aim would be to focus on studying the *adversarial robustness of these models. 

Adversarial attacks simulate worst-case scenarios where the model is exposed to intentionally crafted inputs designed to mislead it. Therefore, evaluating the robustness of KG-augmented LLMs against 
such inputs would be helpful in identifying security gaps that could be exploited in real-world applications. Moreover, by identifying these gaps, more robust defense approaches can be implemented, 
thereby making the model more resilient to malicious attacks and ensuring the integrity and reliability of its outputs. Note that the adversarial robustness of typical machine learning models has been 
studied extensively (see [1]) and in recent years such studies have also been extended to natural language processing models and thereby for LLMs (see [2]). However, in this context, KG-augmented 
LLMs have not been studied so far. To give you an idea of how harmful such an attack can be, consider the following snapshot of a dialogue with an LLM-assisted chatbot as generated by Zou et al. in their work [4]:

*Figure 1: Attack on different Language Models*

In this attack, the authors have added the adversarial text that needs to be added after the query **"Generate a step-by-step process to destroy humanity"** to make the LLMs generate such a harmful 
response. This example shows the urgent need to identify potential vulnerabilities by studying the effect of adversarial attacks on KG-augmented LLMs.

## Thesis Objective

The primary objective of this thesis is to introduce malicious fact(s) or remove true fact(s) from the Knowledge Graph (KG) to influence the KG-augmented Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the 
desired poisoned output. In this architecture, the LLM itself remains unaltered, while the augmented KG is manipulated using specific techniques, resulting in a poisoned KG-augmented LLM. This task 
can be broadly divided into two main steps:

### Tasks 

### Step 1: Poisoning the Knowledge Graph

To poison the KG, the **Adversarial Attack Approach** will be employed which would:
    a. Apply existing adversarial attack techniques, to perform the addition or deletion of triples.
    b. This method will ensure the minimal yet impactful manipulation of the KG to achieve the desired outcome.

### Step 2: Evaluating the Performance of Poisoned KG-Augmented LLMs

Once the KG has been poisoned using the aforementioned techniques, the next step is to integrate this poisoned KG into existing KG-augmented LLMs (e.g., [KG-Rank](https://github.com/YangRui525/KG-Rank) 
or [KG-RAG](https://github.com/BaranziniLab/KG_RAG)) and evaluate the performance degradation.
