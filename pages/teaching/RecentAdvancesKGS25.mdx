## Content

The Semantic Web is an extension of the WWW which allows data to be read and interpreted by both humans and machines. In its initial instantiation, it was grounded in a number of formal languages such as RDF (Resource Framework Description), OWL and SPARQL. Once enriched with these languages , the Web (including Web pages and other data sources) became meaningful to software programs and thus enable machines (e.g., software agents) to interact with the Web in way similar to humans. The formal requirements from the languages aforementioned were however regarded by many practitioners as being too rigid. One of the important types of data source found on the Web of Data are hence knowledge graphs, which implement a broad spectrum of formalisms to represent and query interconnected semantic graph networks which describe entities and their interrelations. While the “knowledge graph” was popularized by Google in 2012 to label, it is now used by a plethora of companies to describe a multitude of datasets using formalisms of varying expressiveness and semantics, which are used to tackle real-world problems.

In this seminar, students will study novel research results from Knowledge Graphs and adjacent fields with the aim of deepening their knowledge of the field. A particular focus will be on LLMs, RAG, and Machine learning for querying. A beneficial side-effect will be a deepening of the students’ expertise in scientific writing.

## Structure

The course consists of single sessions which will introduce the students to topics related to Knowledge Graphs, scientific writing, and scientific presentations. Each student will be assigned a paper to read and present within the first two sessions.

## Evaluation

The students’ performance will be evaluated as follows:

**Scientific Presentation (33%)**: Every student will present the paper they were assigned/selected for presentation within a mini-conference format with allocated time slots The attendance to the mini-conference is mandatory.

**Final Report (67%)**: The students will submit a report (20 pages, written using the provided LaTeX template) on current research in the area of their paper containing a formal presentation of the problem, an explanation of related works, existing methodologies along with a discussion about their pros and cons.
