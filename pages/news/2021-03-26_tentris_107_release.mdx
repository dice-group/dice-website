We are happy to announce version [1.0.7 of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tentris</span> ](https://github.com/dice-group/tentris/releases/tag/1.0.7).

This update is mainly a follow-up to the initial <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tentris</span> paper at ISWC2020. 
In the [paper](https://tentris.dice-research.org/) our analysis showed that <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tentris</span>  was fastest for queries with large results but fell behind for some queries with large results. 
We suspected the reason was <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tentris</span>' JSON serialization engine; what turned out to be true. 
With <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tentris</span> 1.0.7 this problem is solved.

The main improvements compared to [<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tentris</span> 1.0.5.1](https://github.com/dice-group/tentris/releases/tag/1.0.5.1) (version from the paper) at a glance:
* Several fixes to result serialization. A faster SAX parser based on [RapidJSON](https://rapidjson.org/) is used now.
* Improved and fixed einsum operator graph from [hypertrie/0.5.3](https://github.com/dice-group/hypertrie/releases/tag/0.5.3)
* Support for chunked HTTP (streaming)
* Fixed and improved Dockerfile
* General improvements to the build process


A mini benchmark on the SWDF dataset from the paper shows the significant improvement of the new version:

import Plot from '../../scripts/src/components/plotly';

import figure1 from '../../images/news/tentris107_all.json';

<Plot
  data={figure1.data}
  layout={figure1.layout}
  config={figure1.config}
/>

Throughput and Query Mixes per Hour (QMpH) are more than doubled. Those metrics are most sensitive to the performance of the few larger, long-running queries. 
Queries per second (QpS) on the other hand is more robust to single queries taking a long time. 
As expected, it stays stable between the versions.

Another exciting new feature of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tentris</span> 1.0.7 is the chunked HTTP endpoint available at `http://127.0.0.1:9080/stream`.
It works just as the normal `/sparql` endpoint but streams the result. 
When this endpoint is used, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tentris</span> calculates a solution, hands it to the client and forgets it. 
This way, large-scale results are retrievable without full materialization in memory.
