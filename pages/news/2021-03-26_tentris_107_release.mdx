We are happy to announce an update to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tentris</span> 1.0.7.

The main improvements at a glance:
* improved and fixed einsum operator graph from hypertrie/0.5.3
* several fixes to result serialization. A rapid SAX parser based on rapidJSON is used now.
* chunked HTTP (streaming) of results
* fixed Dockerfile
* improved build process

This update is mainly a follow-up to the initial <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tentris</span> paper at ISWC2020. In the Analysis we found that <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tentris</span> didn't perform best in for very large queries. We had pinpointed the reason to be the json serialization engine. With <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tentris</span> 1.0.7 this problem is solved.

Another exciting feature is the chunked HTTP endpoint available at `http://127.0.0.1:9080/stream`.
It works just as the normal `/sparql` endpoint but streams the result. Solutions are simply streamed to the client as they are calculated.
This way, hugh results can be retrieved without <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tentris</span> needing to store it temporarily.

A mini benchmark on the SWDF dataset from the paper, shows the effect of improved serialization.
Throughput in MB/s as well as Query Mixes per Hour QMpH shows a noticeable improvement since those metrics are most sensitive to larger, long-running queries.
Queries per second (QpS) stays mostly at the same level.
