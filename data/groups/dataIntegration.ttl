  schema:content """
The Linked Data paradigm builds upon the backbone of distributed knowledge bases connected by typed links. 
The mere volume of current knowledge bases as well as their sheer number pose two major challenges when aiming to support the integration of data across and within them. 
The first is that tools for data integration have to be time-efficient specially when to deal with big datasets.
Secondly, these tools have to carry out the data integration tasks of high quality to serve the applications built upon Linked Data well. 
Our solutions to the second problem build upon efficient computational approaches developed to solve the first and combine these with dedicated machine learning techniques. 
All our frameworks for data integration such as LIMES and DEER are open-source and available under a GNU license at https: //github.com/dice-group together with user/developer manuals.
