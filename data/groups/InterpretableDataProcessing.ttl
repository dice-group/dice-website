  schema:content """The Interpretable Data Processing group works on two main fields.

Firstly, we are gathering, preparing and analysing Linked Data. 
The first part of this pipeline is done by using our open-source 
crawler <a href="https://dice-research.org/Squirrel">Squirrel<a/>. 
This crawler has been used in several projects, including the two research projects OPAL and LIMBO.
After data has been gathered, we provide several Fact Checking services including 
<a href="https://github.com/dice-group/COPAAL">COPAAL</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dice-group/FactCheck">FactCheck</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dice-group/HybridFC">HybridFC</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dice-group/TemporalFC">TemporalFC</a>, and 
<a href="https://github.com/dice-group/favel">FAVEL</a>, which 
can be used to ensure the veracity of the data with respect to a reference knowledge base or a reference corpus.
We also apply these tools in our research project NEBULA.

The second main field this group is working on is benchmarking. We are maintaining several benchmarking platforms and tools:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dice-research.org/HOBBIT-demo">HOBBIT</a> is a holistic benchmarking platform for Big Linked Data solutions.</li>
<li><a href="https://dice-research.org/GERBIL">GERBIL</a> is a light-weight platform for benchmarking web services. Currently we are supporting the benchmarking within three areas:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://dice-research.org/GerbilKBC">Knowledge Extraction</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://dice-research.org/GerbilQA">Question Answering</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://dice-research.org/GerbilKBC">Knowledge Base Curation</a></li>
  </ul>
<li><a href="https://dice-research.org/IGUANA">IGUANA</a> is a benchmarking platform for evaluating the performance of triple stores.</li>
<li><a href="https://dice-research.org/Palmetto">Palmetto</a> is an evaluation tool for topic models.</li>
</ul>
We also cover additional research areas that are connected to benchmarking like
<ul>
<li> The explainability of benchmarking results,</li>
<li> The generation of synthetic benchmarking data mimiking real-world data, and</li>
<li> Evaluating the robustness of Linked-Data-based approaches.</li>
</ul>
