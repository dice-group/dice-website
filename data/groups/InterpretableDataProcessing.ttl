  schema:content """The Data Analysis group works on two main fields.

Firstly, we are gathering, preparing and analysing Linked Data. The first part of this pipeline is done by using our open-source crawler <a href="https://dice-research.org/Squirrel">Squirrel<a/>. This crawler has been used in several projects, including the two research projects OPAL and LIMBO.

After data has been gathered, we provide Fact Checking services like <a href="https://dice-research.org/COPAAL">COPAAL</a> and <a href="https://dice-research.org/FactCheck">FactCheck</a> that can be used to ensure the veracity of the data with respect to a reference knowledge base or a reference corpus.

The second main field this group is working on is benchmarking. We are maintaining several benchmarking platforms:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dice-research.org/Hobbit">HOBBIT</a> is a holistic benchmarking platform for Big Linked Data solutions.</li>
<li><a href="https://dice-research.org/Gerbil">GERBIL</a> is a light-weight platform for benchmarking web services. Currently we are supporting the benchmarking within three areas:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://dice-research.org/GerbilKE">Knowledge Extraction</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://dice-research.org/GerbilQA">Question Answering</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://dice-research.org/GerbilKBC">Knowledge Base Curation</a></li>
  </ul>
<li>IGUANA is a benchmarking platform for evaluating the performance of triple stores.
</ul>
Additionally, we are in general interested in the area of benchmarking and provide several benchmarks,
