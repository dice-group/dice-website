The machine learning group focuses on machine learning technologies for knowledge graphs. The research goal is to develop novel, scalable machine learning algorithms, e.g., for knowledge graph embeddings, clustering of high-dimensional data, and explainable machine learning. The research activities of the ML group are in the scope of structured machine learning, e.g., efficient learning of concepts in description logics, and knowledge graph embeddings (e.g., based on Clifford Algebras). The group provides open-source tools (e.g., Ontolearn (https://github.com/dice-group/Ontolearn), DICE-Embeddings (https://github.com/dice-group/dice-embeddings), and OWLAPy (https://github.com/dice-group/owlapy)) for machine learning on knowledge graphs.
