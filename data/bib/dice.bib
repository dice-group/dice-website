  abstract = {The number of datasets on the web of data increases continuously. However, the knowledge contained therein cannot be fully utilized without finding links between the entities contained in these datasets. Equivalent entities can not be identified solely by checking the equivalence of IRIs because of the different origins and naming schemes of different data providers. Yet, such equivalences can be discovered by computing the similarity of their attributes. In this paper we propose GLIDE, an approach that links entities from two different datasets by embedding a joint model of these datasets enriched by additional relations describing the similarity of literals. The joint model is embedded into a latent vector space while paying attention to juxtaposing similar literals. We evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art algorithms using real-world datasets commonly used in link discovery literature. The results show that GLIDE outperforms all baselines on 5 of 7 datasets with perfect or near-perfect accuracy. Our approach achieves its best performance on datasets that feature several literals with similarities. Our experiments indicate that researchers should not only pay attention to equal literals in knowledge graph embedding but should also be aware of the distance between similar literals.},

	abstract = {Popular knowledge bases that provide SPARQL endpoints for the web are usually experiencing a high number of requests, which often results in low availability of their interfaces. A common approach to counter the availabfedility issue is to run a local mirror of the knowledge base. Running a SPARQL endpoint is currently a complex task which requires a lot of effort and technical support for domain experts who just want to use the SPARQL interface. With our approach of containerised knowledge base shipping we are introducing a simple to setup methodology for running a local mirror of an RDF knowledge base and SPARQL endpoint with interchangeable exploration components. The flexibility of the presented approach further helps maintaining the publication infrastructure for dataset projects. We are demonstrating and evaluating the presented methodology at the example of the dataset projects DBpedia, Catalogus Professorum Lipsiensium and S{\"a}chsisches Pfarrerbuch.},

	abstract = {Scholars often need to search for matching, high-profile scientific events to publish their research results. Information about topical focus and quality of events is not made sufficiently explicit in the existing communication channels where events are announced. Therefore, scholars have to spend a lot of time on reading and assessing calls for papers but might still not find the right event. Additionally, events might be overlooked because of the large number of events announced every day. We introduce OpenResearch, a crowd sourcing platform that supports researchers in collecting, organizing, sharing and disseminating information about scientific events in a structured way. It enables quality-related queries over a multidisciplinary collection of events according to a broad range of criteria such as acceptance rate, sustainability of event series, and reputation of people and organizations. Events are represented in different views using map extensions, calendar and time-line visualizations. We have systematically evaluated the timeliness, usability and performance of OpenResearch.},

To the best of our knowledge, no suitable data corpora are available for systematic research until now. The Information System Graffiti in Germany project (INGRID) closes this gap by dealing with graffiti image collections that have been made available to the project for public use. Within INGRID, the graffiti images are collected, digitized and annotated. With this work, we aim to support the rapid access to a comprehensive data source on INGRID targeted especially by researchers. In particular, we present INGRIDKG, an RDF knowledge graph of annotated graffiti, abides by the Linked Data and FAIR principles. We weekly update INGRIDKG by augmenting the new annotated graffiti to our knowledge graph. Our generation pipeline applies RDF data conversion, link discovery and data fusion approaches to the original data. The current version of INGRIDKG contains 460, 640, 154 triples and is linked to 3 other knowledge graphs by over 200, 000 links. In our use case studies, we demonstrate the usefulness of our knowledge graph for different applications.},

The components of such augmentation pipelines often require extensive configuration to lead to satisfactory results. Thus, non-experts are often unable to use them. Wepresent an efficient supervised algorithm based on genetic programming for learning knowledge graph augmentation pipelines of arbitrary length. Our approach uses multi-expression learning to learn augmentation pipelines able to achieve a high F-measure on	the training data. Our evaluation suggests that our approach can efficiently learn a larger class of RDF dataset augmentation tasks than the state of the art while using only a single training example. Even on the most complex augmentation problem we posed, our approach consistently achieves an average F1-measure of 99% in under 500 iterations with an average runtime of 16 seconds},

	abstract = {The Linked Data paradigm builds upon the backbone of distributed knowledge bases connected by typed links. The mere volume of current knowledge bases as well as their sheer number pose two major challenges when aiming to support the computation of links across and within them. The first is that tools for link discovery have to be time-efficient when they compute links. Secondly, these tools have to produce links of high quality to serve the applications built upon Linked Data well. Solutions to the second problem build upon efficient computational approaches developed to solve the first and combine these with dedicated machine learning techniques. The current version of the LIMES framework is the product of seven years of research on these two challenges. A series of machine learning techniques and efficient computation approaches were developed and integrated into this framework to address the link discovery problem. The framework combines these diverse algorithms within a generic and extensible architecture. In this article, we give an overview of version 1.7.4 of the open-source release of the framework. In particular, we focus on an overview of the architecture of the framework, an intuition of its inner workings and a brief overview of the approaches it contains. Some descriptions of the applications within which the framework was used complete the paper. Our framework is open-source and available under a GNU license at https: //github.com/dice-group/LIMES together with a user manual and a developer manual.},

Declarative Link Discovery (LD) frameworks rely on complex Link Specification (LS) to express the conditions under which two resources should be linked. Understanding such LS is not a trivial task for non-expert users. Particularly when such users are interested in generating LS to match their needs. Even if the user applies a machine learning algorithm for the automatic generation of the required LS, the challenge of explaining the resultant LS persists. Hence, providing explainable LS is the key challenge to enable users who are unfamiliar with underlying LS technologies to use them effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we extend our previous work (Ahmed et al., 2019) by proposing a generic multilingual approach that allows verbalization of LS in many languages, i.e., converts LS into understandable natural language text. In this work, we ported our LS verbalization framework into German and Spanish, in addition to English language. Our adequacy and fluency evaluations show that our approach can generate complete and easily understandable natural language descriptions even by lay users. Moreover, we devised an experimental neural approach for improving the quality of our generated texts. Our neural approach achieves promising results in terms of BLEU, METEOR and chrF++.},

	abstract = {Modern data-driven frameworks often have to process large amounts of data periodically. Hence, they often operate under time or space constraints. This also holds for Linked Data-driven frameworks when processing RDF data, in particular, when they perform link discovery tasks. In this work, we present a novel approach for link discovery under constraints pertaining to the expected recall of a link discovery task. Given a link specification, the approach aims to find a subsumed link specification that achieves a lower run time than the input specification while abiding by a predefined constraint on the expected recall it has to achieve. Our approach, dubbed LIGER, combines downward refinement oper- ators with monotonicity assumptions to detect such specifications. We evaluate our approach on seven datasets. Our results suggest that the different implemen- tations of LIGER can detect subsumed specifications that abide by expected recall constraints efficiently, thus leading to significantly shorter overall run times than our baseline.},

@inproceedings{hecate_om_2020,
	abstract = {With the growth in number and variety of RDF datasets comes an in- creasing need for both scalable and accurate solutions to support link discovery at instance level within and across these datasets. In contrast to ontology matching, most linking frameworks rely solely on string similarities to this end. The limited use of semantic similarities when linking instances is partly due to the current literature stating that they (1) do not improve the F-measure of instance linking approaches and (2) are impractical to use because they lack time efficiency. We revisit the combination of string and semantic similarities for linking instances. Contrary to the literature, our results suggest that this combination can improve the F-measure achieved by instance linking systems when the combination of the measures is performed by a machine learning approach. To achieve this in- sight, we had to address the scalability of semantic similarities. We hence present a framework for the rapid computation of semantic similarities based on edge counting. This runtime improvement allowed us to run an evaluation of 5 bench- mark datasets. Our results suggest that combining string and semantic similarities can improve the F-measure by up to 6% absolute.},

	abstract = {Link discovery plays a key role in the integration and use of data across RDF knowledge graphs. Active learning approaches are a common family of solutions to address the problem of learning how to compute links from users. So far, only active learning from perfect oracles has been considered in the literature. However, real oracles are often far from perfect (e.g., in crowdsourcing). We hence study the problem of learning how to compute links across knowledge graphs from noisy oracles, i.e., oracles that are not guaranteed to return correct classification results. We present a novel approach for link discovery based on a probabilistic model, with which we estimate the joint odds of the oracles' guesses. We combine this approach with an iterative learning approach based on refinements. The resulting method, Ligon, is evaluated on 10 benchmark datasets. Our results suggest that Ligon configured with 10 iterations and 10 training examples per iteration achieves more than 95% of the F-measure achieved by state-of-the-art algorithms trained with a perfect oracle. Moreover, Ligon outperforms batch learning approaches devised to be trained with small amounts of training data by more than 40% F-measure on average.},

Limes, the Link Discovery Framework for Metric Spaces, is a framework for dis- covering links between entities contained in Linked Data sources.

By representing the link specifications (LS) as interlocking blocks, our interface eases the manual creation of links for users who already know which LS they would like to execute. How- ever, most users do not know which LS suits their linking task best and therefore need help throughout this process. Hence, our interface provides wizards which allow the easy configuration of many link discovery machine learning algorithms, that does not require the user to enter a manual LS. We evaluate the usability of the interface by using the standard system usability scale questionnaire. Our over- all usability score of 76.5 suggests that the online interface is consistent, easy to use, and the various functions of the system are well integrated.},

	abstract = {Point of Interest (POI) data constitute the cornerstone of any application, service or product even remotely related to our physical surroundings. From navigation applications to social networks, tourism, and logistics, we use POI data to search, communicate, decide and plan our actions. POIs are semantically diverse and spatio-temporally evolving entities, having geographical, temporal and thematic relations. Currently, integrating POI data to increase their coverage, timeliness, accuracy and value is a resource-intensive and mostly manual process, with no specialized software available to address the specific challenges of this task. In this paper, we present an integrated toolkit for transforming, linking, fusing and enriching POI data, and extracting additional value from them. In particular, we demonstrate how Linked Data technologies can address the limitations, gaps and challenges of the current landscape in Big POI data integration. We have built a prototype application that enables users to define, manage and execute scalable POI data integration workflows built on top of state-of-the-art software for geospatial Linked Data. The application abstracts and hides away the underlying complexity, automates quality-assured integration, scales efficiently for world-scale integration tasks and lowers the entry barrier for end-users. Validated against real-world POI datasets in several application domains, our system has shown great potential to address the requirements and needs of cross-sector, cross-border and cross-lingual integration of Big POI data.},

We analyzed the most common errors encountered in Linked Data sources and classified them according to the extent to which they are likely to be amenable to a specific crowdsourcing approach. Based on this analysis, we implemented and compared two quality assessment methods for Linked Data that leverage the wisdom of the crowds in different ways: (i) a contest format targeting an expert crowd of researchers and Linked Data enthusiasts; and (ii) paid microtasks published on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We evaluated the two methods empirically in terms of their capacity to spot quality issues in DBpedia and investigated how the contributions of the two crowds could be optimally integrated into Linked Data curation processes. The results showed that the two styles of crowdsourcing are complementary, and that crowdsourcing-enabled quality assessment is a promising and affordable way to enhance the quality of Linked Data sets.},

	abstract = {The World Wide Web is an infrastructure to publish and retrieve information through web resources. It evolved from a static Web 1.0 to a multimodal and interactive communication and information space which is used to collaboratively contribute and discuss web resources, which is better known as Web 2.0. The evolution into a Semantic Web (Web 3.0) proceeds. One of its remarkable advantages is the decentralized and interlinked data composition. Hence, in contrast to its data distribution, workflows and technologies for decentralized collaborative contribution are missing. In this paper we propose the Structured Feedback protocol as an interactive addition to the Web of Data. It offers support for users to contribute to the evolution of web resources, by providing structured data artifacts as patches for web resources, as well as simple plain text comments. Based on this approach it enables crowd-supported quality assessment and web data cleansing processes in an ad-hoc fashion most web users are familiar with.},

In this network and its genesis, collaboration played and still plays a crucial role.
But currently we only have central collaboration solutions for RDF data, such as SPARQL endpoints and wiki systems, while decentralized solutions can enable applications for many more use-cases.
Inspired by a successful distributed source code management methodology in software engineering a framework to support distributed evolution is proposed.
The system is based on Git and provides distributed collaboration on RDF graphs.
This paper covers the formal expression of the evolution and consolidation of distributed datasets, the synchronization, as well as other supporting operations.},

@inproceedings{arndt-n-2019--jekyll-rdf,
	abstract = {Over the last decades the Web has evolved from a human--human communication network to a network of complex human--machine interactions.
An increasing amount of data is available as Linked Data which allows machines to ``understand'' the data, but RDF is not meant to be understood by humans.
With Jekyll RDF we present a method to close the gap between structured data and human accessible exploration interfaces by publishing RDF datasets as customizable static HTML sites.
It consists of an RDF resource mapping system to serve the resources under their respective IRI, a template mapping based on schema classes, and a markup language to define templates to render customized resource pages.
Using the template system, it is possible to create domain specific browsing interfaces for RDF data next to the Linked Data resources.
This enables content management and knowledge management systems to serve datasets in a highly customizable, low effort, and scalable way to be consumed by machines as well as humans.},

Especially in the domain of digital humanities and when dealing with Linked Data in an enterprise context provenance information is needed to support the collaborative process of data management.
We are proposing a possibility for capturing and exploring provenance information, based on the methodology of managing RDF data in a tool stack on top of the decentralized source code management system Git.
This comprises a queriable history graph, the possibility to query arbitrary revisions of a Git versioned store and in the minimal granularity the possibility to annotate individual statements with their provenance information.},

The distributed character of the Web brings manifold collaborative possibilities to interchange data. The commonly adopted collaborative solutions for RDF data are centralized (e.g. SPARQL endpoints and wiki systems). But to support distributed collaboration, a system is needed, that supports divergence of datasets, brings the possibility to conflate diverged states, and allows distributed datasets to be synchronized. In this paper, we present Quit Store, it was inspired by and it builds upon the successful Git system. The approach is based on a formal expression of evolution and consolidation of distributed datasets. During the collaborative curation process, the system automatically versions the RDF dataset and tracks provenance information. It also provides support to branch, merge, and synchronize distributed RDF datasets. The merging process is guarded by specific merge strategies for RDF data. Finally, we use our reference implementation to show overall good performance and demonstrate the practical usability of the system.},

@inproceedings{Auer+ICWE-2017,
	abstract = {The management and analysis of large-scale datasets -- described with the term Big Data -- involves the three classic dimensions volume, velocity and variety.
While the former two are well supported by a plethora of software components, the variety dimension is still rather neglected.
We present the BDE platform -- an easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use and adaptable (cluster-based and standalone) platform for the execution of big data components and tools like Hadoop, Spark, Flink.
The BDE platform was designed based upon the requirements gathered from the seven societal challenges put forward by the European Commission in the Horizon 2020 programme and targeted by the BigDataEurope pilots.
As a result, the BDE platform allows to perform a variety of Big Data flow tasks like message passing (Kafka, Flume), storage (Hive, Cassandra) or publishing (GeoTriples).
In order to facilitate the processing of heterogeneous data, a particular innovation of the platform is the semantic layer, which allows to directly process RDF data and to map and transform arbitrary data into RDF.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this system paper, we describe the DL-Learner framework, which supports supervised machine learning using \{OWL\} and \{RDF\} for background knowledge representation. It can be beneficial in various data and schema analysis tasks with applications in different standard machine learning scenarios, e.g. in the life sciences, as well as Semantic Web specific applications such as ontology learning and enrichment. Since its creation in 2007, it has become the main \{OWL\} and RDF-based software framework for supervised structured machine learning and includes several algorithm implementations, usage examples and has applications building on top of the framework. The article gives an overview of the framework with a focus on algorithms and use cases.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, we observed a steadily increasing amount of RDF datasets made available on the web of data. The decentralized nature of the web, however, makes it hard to identify all these datasets. Even more so, when downloadable data distributions are discovered, only insufficient metadata is available to describe the datasets properly, thus posing barriers on its usefulness and reuse. In this paper, we describe an attempt to exhaustively identify the whole linked open data cloud by harvesting metadata from multiple sources, providing insights about duplicated data and the general quality of the available metadata. This was only possible by using a probabilistic data structure called Bloom filter.
 Finally, we published a dump file containing metadata which can further be used to enrich existent datasets.},

	abstract = {{Web-based information systems provide access to information originating from multiple information providers inside the company, from partner organizations, and from the public Web. The quality of provided information may vary as information providers have different levels of knowledge, different views of the world, and different intentions. Thus before information is used to accomplish a specific task, its quality should be assessed according to task-specific criteria. The goal of the thesis is to develop and evaluate a quality-driven information filtering framework which supports information consumers in their decision whether to accept or reject information. The main objective of the framework is to allow information consumers to apply a wide range of different subjective filtering policies. In order to facilitate the information consumers understanding of filtering decisions, the framework can generate explanations why information satisfies a specific policy. The framework is integrated into a web browser and is applied within a financial information integration scenario.}},

Unfortunately, for most of the languages the amount and quality of available lexicographical data is suboptimal, even though its availability is essential for all educational institutions and for the development of state-of-the-art language technology. In this paper we present a new source of lexicographical data for Xhosa, a language spoken by more than eight million speakers. For its utilisation in a multilingual and federated environment it is modelled using a dedicated OWL ontology for Bantu languages and possesses all features that are currently considered integral for the promotion of resource reuse as well as long-term usage. In the future, the introduced ontology may be used for other Bantu languages as well and may ease their combination to achieve more extensive, multilingual data stocks.},

@article{Chaladze2014,
	abstract = {Precise information on spatial patterns of species richness and endemic species distribution is important for effective species conservation. In the Caucasus Ecoregion such information is virtually non-existent for invertebrate taxa. Using occurrence data from a large database we calculated species distribution models with the GARP algorithm for 471 spider species to visualize the diversity distribution of spider species in this region. Overall species diversity was highest in mountain forests of the North Caucasus, east-central Georgia, the southern slopes of the eastern Great Caucasus and south-east Azerbaijan. A regression tree analysis Chi squared automatic interaction detector method revealed the mean temperature of the driest quarter and precipitation parameters to be the main environmental factors shaping these patterns. Diversity of endemic species was correlated with overall species diversity but hotspots of endemic species (10+ percent of all species) exists in high-mountain areas, suggesting post-glacial speciation events in the high mountains as the main sources of high endemism in Caucasus. Further information on the spatial distribution of species diversity of invertebrate taxa in the Caucasus Ecoregion is needed to improve conservation efforts in this biodiversity hotspot.},

@inproceedings{coelho-2017-semantics-tanker,
	abstract = {Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation (NERD) systems have recently been widely researched to deal with the significant growth of the Web. NERD systems are crucial for several Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as summarization, understanding, and machine translation. However, there is no standard interface specification, i.e. these systems may vary significantly either for exporting their outputs or for processing the inputs. Thus, when a given company desires to implement more than one NERD system, the process is quite exhaustive and prone to failure. In addition, industrial solutions demand critical requirements, e.g., large-scale processing, completeness, versatility, and licenses. Commonly, these requirements impose a limitation, making good NERD models to be ignored by companies. This paper presents TANKER, a distributed architecture which aims to overcome scalability, reliability and failure tolerance limitations related to industrial needs by combining NERD systems. To this end, TANKER re-lies on a micro-services oriented architecture, which enables agile development and delivery of complex enterprise applications. In addition, TANKER provides a standardized API which makes possible to combine several NERD systems at once.},

@incollection{2011dispedia,
	abstract = {The challenge of developing information systems for rare diseases is in harmonizing social care conditions and health care conditions with the focus on personalization and patient autonomy. Knowledge about the most rare diseases is limited, which is the result of poorly funded research and the existence of only a few specialized experts. Furthermore, the treatment and care of the affected patients is very complex, cost-intensive, time critical, and involved stakeholders are very heterogeneous. The information needed by the patient depends on his or her personal situation and constitution. To support the information logistics between patients of rare diseases and (all) other stakeholders (e.g. physicians, therapists, and researchers), we developed an information system with Linked Open Data technologies in order to create a platform and tool independent solution addressing the heterogeneity of the stakeholders. To engineer system and data model requirements of our approach we analyzed the rare disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which have wide-spreaded characteristics. The resulting formal knowledge representation was encoded in OWL, which allows, for instance, a modular development of complex areas and also the re-usage of existing knowledge bases.},

@inproceedings{ermilov-ivan-2013-isem,
	abstract = {Governments and public administrations started recently to publish large amounts of structured data on the Web, mostly in the form of tabular data such as CSV files or Excel sheets. Various tools and projects have been launched aiming at facilitating the lifting of tabular data to reach semantically structured and linked data. However, none of these tools supported a truly incremental, pay-as-you-go data publication and mapping strategy, which enables effort sharing between data owners, community experts and consumers. In this article, we present an approach for enabling the user-driven semantic mapping of large amounts tabular data. We devise a simple mapping language for tabular data, which is easy to understand even for casual users, but expressive enough to cover the vast majority of potential tabular mappings use cases. We outline a formal approach for mapping tabular data to RDF. Default mappings are automatically created and can be revised by the community using a semantic wiki. The mappings are executed using a sophisticated streaming RDB2RDF conversion. We report about the deployment of our approach at the Pan-European data portal PublicData.eu, where we transformed and enriched almost 10,000 datasets accounting for 7.3 billion triples.},

	abstract = {While the amount of data on the Web grows at 57\% per year, the Web of Science maintains a considerable amount of inertia, as yearly growth varies between 1.6\% and 14\%. On the other hand, the Web of Science consists of high quality information created and reviewed by the international community of researchers. While it is a complicated process to switch from traditional publishing methods to methods, which enable data publishing in machine-readable formats, the situation can be improved by at least exposing metadata about the scientific publications in machine-readable format. In this paper we aim at metadata, hidden inside universities' internal databases, reports and other hard to discover sources. We extend the VIVO ontology and create the VIVO+ ontology. We define and describe a framework for automatic conversion of university data to RDF. We showcase the VIVO+ ontology and the framework using the example of the ITMO university.},

In this paper, we present LODStats, which provides a comprehensive picture of the current state of a significant part of the Data Web. LODStats integrates RDF datasets from data.gov, publicdata.eu and datahub.io data catalogs and at the time of writing lists over 9 000 RDF datasets. For each RDF dataset, LODStats collects comprehensive statistics and makes these available in adhering to the LDSO vocabulary.

	abstract = {The Web encompasses a significant amount of knowledge hidden in entity-attributes tables. Bridging the gap between these tables and the Web of Data thus has the potential to facilitate a large number of applications, including the augmentation of knowledge bases from tables, the search for related tables and the completion of tables using knowledge bases. Computing such bridges is impeded by the poor accuracy of automatic property mapping, the lack of approaches for the discovery of subject columns and the mere size of table corpora. In addition, tables on the Web most commonly do not contain any RDFa or other form of semantic annotation. We propose TAIPAN, a novel approach for recovering the semantics of tables. Our approach begins by identifying subject columns using a combination of structural and semantic features. It then maps binary relations inside a table to predicates from a given knowledge base. Therewith, our solution supports both the tasks of table expansion and knowledge base augmentation. We evaluate our approach on a table dataset generated from real RDF data and a manually curated version of the T2D gold standard. Our results suggest that we outperform the state of the art by up to 85\% F-measure.},

For any particular source and use (e.g. exploration, visualization, integration) of such information special applications have to be written. This limits the overall usability of the information provided and makes it diffcult to access information resources. These limitations can be overridden, if the information will be provided using a homogeneous data and access model complying with the Linked Data principles. In this paper we showcase how raw Open Government Data (OGD) from heterogeneous sources can be processed, converted, published and used on the Web of Linked Data. In particular we demonstrate our experience in processing of OGD on two use cases: the Digital Agenda Scoreboard and the Financial Transparency System of the European Commission.},

@inproceedings{estevesMEX2016,
	abstract = {Despite recent efforts to achieve a high level of interoperability of Machine Learning (ML) experiments, positively collaborating with the Reproducible Research context, we still run into the problems created due to the existence of different ML platforms: each of those have a specific conceptualization or schema for representing data and metadata. This scenario leads to an extra coding-effort to achieve both the desired interoperability and a better provenance level as well as a more automatized environment for obtaining the generated results. Hence, when using ML libraries, it is a common task to re-design specific data models (schemata) and develop wrappers to manage the produced outputs. In this article, we discuss this gap focusing on the solution for the question: ``What is the cleanest and lowest-impact solution to achieve both higher interoperability and provenance metadata levels in the Integrated Development Environments (IDE) context and how to facilitate the inherent data querying task?''. We introduce a novel and low impact methodology specifically designed for code built in that context, combining semantic web concepts and reflection in order to minimize the gap for exporting ML metadata in a structured manner, allowing embedded code annotations that are, in run-time, converted in one of the state-of-the-art ML schemas for the Semantic Web: the MEX Vocabulary.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades many machine learning experiments have been published, giving benefit to the scientific progress. In order to compare machine-learning experiment results with each other and collaborate positively, they need to be performed thoroughly on the same computing environment, using the same sample datasets and algorithm configurations. Besides this, practical experience shows that scientists and engineers tend to have large output data in their experiments, which is both difficult to analyze and archive properly without provenance metadata. However, the Linked Data community still misses a light-weight specification for interchanging machine-learning metadata over different architectures to achieve a higher level of interoperability. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a novel vocabulary dubbed MEX. We show that MEX provides a prompt method to describe experiments with a special focus on data provenance and fulfills the requirements for a long-term maintenance.},

	abstract = {Data is the new oil, this quote ascribed to Clive Humby most clearly describes the increasing impact of information on our society and economy. More and more data sets from various sources are published and used for different kinds of applications. Atmospheric reanalysis represents one of the richest and most valuable data sets for the open source community. However, transforming it into valuable information and linking it to other data sets is a challenge, especially for users from non-meteorological domains. In this presentation, we discuss the advantages of applying Linked (Open) Data principles to meteorological data in order to improve data acquisition for regional reanalysis (COSMO-REA2). By converting a COSMO-REA2 subset and linking it to further converted linked data, we illustrate how to gain much more knowledge using this approach. Different demonstrated scenarios, such as infrastructure planning for wind farming or transportation underline the advantage of this approach. Based on that, we argue that data in general and meteorological data in particular should be accessible by following the Linked Data paradigms.},

Although the data and the community created ontology have received immense investment, good tools to query and explore the data are still rare. In this paper, we present a prototype that attempts to break down complexity of graph querying into simple and guided steps. During the implementation of our DBpedia Explorer, we faced many barriers that can be traced back to a lack of data quality as well as the design of the DBpedia Ontology. We investigated these problems in detail based on a small sub-graph of DBpedia and gained valuable insights that will hopefully allow us to apply data trans- formation and fixes to DBpedia that will be beneficial for browsing and querying of the data in the future.},

In an RDF dataset it is possible to store metadata alongside the actual RDF data and several possible Metadata Representation Models (e.g. Singleton Property and n-ary relation) have been proposed. However, studies investigating the performance of these models show that choosing the appropriate metadata representation depends on the used data and metadata, queries and RDF store. To allow a flexible storage and querying of data and its metadata independent of the applied Metadata Representation Model, we propose MaSQue (Metadata Storage and Querying). The approach introduces an intermediate (meta)data serialization format and query annotations as metadata layer on top of RDF and SPARQL.},

This paper presents a survey of patterns to publish Multilingual Linked Data and identifies some issues that should be taken into account. As a use case, the paper describes the patterns employed in the DBpedia Internationalization project.},

@article{gerber2015,
	abstract = {One of the main tasks when creating and maintaining knowledge bases is to validate facts and provide sources for them in order to ensure correctness and traceability of the provided knowledge. So far, this task is often addressed by human curators in a three-step process: issuing appropriate keyword queries for the statement to check using standard search engines, retrieving potentially relevant documents and screening those documents for relevant content. The drawbacks of this process are manifold. Most importantly, it is very time-consuming as the experts have to carry out several search processes and must often read several documents.In this article, we present DeFacto (Deep Fact Validation) - an algorithm able to validate facts by finding trustworthy sources for them on the Web. DeFacto aims to provide an effective way of validating facts by supplying the user with relevant excerpts of web pages as well as useful additional information including a score for the confidence DeFacto has in the correctness of the input fact. To achieve this goal, DeFacto collects and combines evidence from web pages written in several languages. In addition, DeFacto provides support for facts with a temporal scope, i.e., it can estimate in which time frame a fact was valid. Given that the automatic evaluation of facts has not been paid much attention to so far, generic benchmarks for evaluating these frameworks were not previously available. We thus also present a generic evaluation framework for fact checking and make it publicly available.},

This diversity and heterogeneity often involve an increasing difficulty of becoming acquainted with Semantic Web technologies. In this work, we present the SPARQLTrainer approach for educating novices in semantic technologies in a playful way. With SPARQLTrainer educators can devise a SPARQL course by defining a number of exercises either generically or for a specific domain. Learners can complete courses by stepwise answering questions of increasing complexity. These questions usually require the learner to build a SPARQL query for querying a certain knowledge base and using certain SPARQL features. The SPARQL queries created by a learner are compared with example solutions given by the instructor. This comparison takes possible variations into account and gives specific feedback to the learner.},

	abstract = {Most knowledge sources on the Data Web were extracted from structured or semi-structured data. Thus, they encompass solely a small fraction of the information available on the document-oriented Web. In this paper, we present BOA, an iterative bootstrapping strategy for extracting RDF from unstructured data. The idea behind BOA is to use the Data Web as background knowledge for the extraction of natural language patterns that represent predicates found on the Data Web. These patterns are used to extract instance knowledge from natural language text. This knowledge is finally fed back into the Data Web, therewith closing the loop. We evaluate our approach on two data sets using DBpedia as background knowledge. Our results show that we can extract several thousand new facts in one iteration with very high accuracy. Moreover, we provide the first repository of natural language representations of predicates found on the Data Web.},

	abstract = {Interlinking knowledge bases are widely recognized as an important, but challenging problem. A significant amount of research has been undertaken to provide solutions to this problem with varying degrees of automation and user involvement. In this paper, we present a two-staged experiment for the creation of gold standards that act as benchmarks for several interlinking algorithms. In the first stage the gold standards are generated through manual validation process highlighting the role of users. Using the gold standards obtained from this stage, we assess the performance of human evaluators in addition to supervised interlinking algorithms. We evaluate our approach on several data interlinking tasks with respect to precision, recall and F-measure. Additionally we perform a qualitative analysis on the types of errors made by humans and machines.},

	abstract = {Structured data is picking up on the Web, particularly in the search world. Schema.org, jointly initiated by Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! provides a hierarchical set of vocabularies to embed metadata in HTML pages for an enhanced search and browsing experience. RDFa-Lite, Microdata and JSON-LD as lower semantic techniques have gained more attention by Web users to markup Web pages and even emails based on Schema.org. However, from the user interface point of view, we still lack user-friendly tools that facilitate the process of structured content authoring. The majority of information still is contained in and exchanged using unstructured documents, such as Web pages, text documents, images and videos. This can also not be expected to change, since text, images and videos are the natural way how humans interact with information. In this paper we present RDFaCE as an implementation of WYSIWYM (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Mean) concept for direct manipulation of semantically structured content in conventional modalities. RDFaCE utilizes on-the-fly form generation based on Schema.org vocabulary for embedding metadata within Web documents. Furthermore, it employs external NLP services to enable automatic annotation of entities and to suggest URIs for entities. RDFaCE is written as a plugin for TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor thereby can be easily integrated into existing content management systems.},

	abstract = {Recently practical approaches for managing and supporting the life-cycle of semantic content on the Web of Data made quite some progress. However, the currently least developed aspect of the semantic content life-cycle is the user-friendly manual and semi-automatic creation of rich semantic content. In this paper we present the RDFaCE approach for combining WYSIWYG text authoring with the creation of rich semantic annotations. Our approach is based on providing four different views to the content authors: a classical WYSIWYG view, a WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) view making the semantic annotations visible, a fact view and the respective HTML/RDFa source code view. The views are synchronized such that changes made in one of the views automatically update the others. They provide different means of semantic content authoring for the different personas involved in the content creation life-cycle. For bootstrapping the semantic annotation process we integrate five different text annotation services. We evaluate their accuracy and empirically show that a combination of them yields superior results.},

	abstract = {The Web democratized publishing -- everybody can easily publish information on a Website, Blog, in social networks or microblogging systems. The more the amount of published information grows, the more important are technologies for accessing, analysing, summarising and visualising information. While substantial progress has been made in the last years in each of these areas individually, we argue, that only the intelligent combination of approaches will make this progress truly useful and leverage further synergies between techniques. In this paper we develop a text analytics architecture of participation, which allows ordinary people to use sophisticated NLP techniques for analysing and visualizing their content, be it a Blog, Twitter feed, Website or article collection. The architecture comprises interfaces for information access, natural language processing and visualization. Different exchangeable components can be plugged into this architecture, making it easy to tailor for individual needs. We evaluate the usefulness of our approach by comparing both the effectiveness and efficiency of end users within a task-solving setting. Moreover, we evaluate the usability of our approach using a questionnaire-driven approach. Both evaluations suggest that ordinary Web users are empowered to analyse their data and perform tasks, which were previously out of reach.},

Much of the corporate strategy, direction and accumulated knowledge within organizations is encapsulated in presentations. In this paper, we investigate the limitations of current presentation tools for semi-structured knowledge representation and sharing within organizations. We address challenges such as collaborative creation of presentations, tracking changes within them, sharing and reusing existing presentations. Then we present SlideWiki as a crowd-sourcing platform for the elicitation and sharing of corporate knowledge using presentations. With SlideWiki users can author, collaborate and arrange slides in organizational presentations by employing Web 2.0 strategies. Presentations can be organized hierarchically, so as to structure them reasonably according to their content. According to the wiki paradigm, all content in SlideWiki (i.e. slides, decks, themes, diagrams) are versioned and users can fork and merge presentations the same way as modern social coding platforms allow. Moreover, SlideWiki supports social networking activities such as following and discussing presentations for effective knowledge management.

It will be argued that ontolex and decomp provide only a basic modelling of the domain, which is not sufficient for representing fine-grained MLD, but suitable for interconnecting OntoLex with the Multilingual Morpheme Core Ontology (MMoOn Core). Both models each offer a modelling of a linguistic domain - OntoLex for lexical language data and MMoOn Core for morphological language data - that exhibits a notable amount of conceptual overlap. Thus, this paper investigates the potential of exploiting the overlap of both models for initiating an ontology-based interconnection of lexical and morphological datasets.},

We introduce a measure to characterize the morphological complexity of German named entities and apply it to the subset of named entities identified by all systems, and to the subset of named entities none of the systems recognized. We discover that morphologically complex named entities are more prevalent in the latter set than in the former, a finding which should be taken into account in future development of methods of that sort. In addition, we provide an analysis of issues found in the GermEval gold standard annotation, which affected also the performance measurements of the different systems.},

However, there are no models that describe the domain of morphology in a similar manner. As a result, there are hardly any language resources of morphemic data available in RDF to date. This paper presents the creation of the Hebrew Morpheme Inventory from a manually compiled tabular dataset comprising around 52.000 entries. It is an ongoing effort of representing the lexemes, word-forms and morphologigal patterns together with their underlying relations based on the newly created Multilingual Morpheme Ontology (MMoOn). It will be shown how segmented Hebrew language data can be granularly described in a Linked Data format, thus, serving as an exemplary case for creating morpheme inventories of any inflectional language with MMoOn. The resulting dataset is described a) according to the structure of the underlying data format, b) with respect to the Hebrew language characteristic of building word-forms directly from roots, c) by exemplifying how inflectional information is realized and d) with regard to its enrichment with external links to sense resources.},

While terminological resources such as the SIL Glossary of Linguistic Terms, ISOcat or the GOLD ontology provide a considerable amount of linguistic terms, their practical usage is limited to a look up of a defined term whose relation to other terms is unspecified or insufficient. Therefore, in this paper we propose an ontology for linguistic terminology, called OnLiT. It is a data model which can be used to represent linguistic terms and concepts in a semantically interrelated data structure and, thus, overcomes prevalent isolating definition-based term descriptions. OnLiT is based on the LiDo Glossary of Linguistic Terms and enables the creation of RDF datasets, that represent linguistic terms and their meanings within the whole or a subdomain of linguistics.},

Since 2006 students and linguistic researchers benefit from the data by looking it up on the Web. Even though, the LiDo TBD is implemented as a relational database, its underlying framework aims at yielding a terminological network containing data nodes that are connected via specific relation edges in order to create an interrelated data graph. Now, with the emergence of Semantic Web technologies we were able to implement this pioneering work by converting the LiDo TBD relational database into a Linked Data graph. In this paper we present and describe the creation of the LiDo RDF dataset and introduce the LiDo RDF project. The goals of this project are to enable the direct use and reuse of the data both for the scientific research community and machine processing alike as well as to enable a valuable enrichment of already existing linguistic terminological and bibliographic data by including LiDo RDF in the LLOD cloud.},

Since ETL systems produce the RDF offline, any map- ping or content change requires a re-ingest of the relevant source data. When dealing with heterogeneous source datasets, creating a unified tar- get dataset can be a tedious undertaking. Therefore the paper proposes an RDF view based ingestion approach, which allows real-time ``debug- ging'' of the unified dataset where mappings and links can be changed with immediate effect. Once the unified graph passes all data quality tests, the RDF can be materialized. This process poses an alternative to existing ETL solutions.},

	abstract = {The DBpedia project provides Linked Data identifiers for currently 2.6 million things and serves a large knowledge base of structured information. DBpedia developed into the central interlinking hub for the Linking Open Data project, its URIs are used within named entity recognition services such as OpenCalais and annotation services such as Faviki, and the BBC started using DBpedia as their central semantic backbone. DBpedia's structured data serves as background information in the process interlinking datasets and provides a rich source of information for application developers. Beside making the DBpedia knowledge base available as linked data and RDF dumps, we offer a Lookup Service which can be used by applications to discover URIs for identifying concepts, and a SPARQL endpoint that can be retrieve data from the DBpedia knowledge base to be used in applications. This talk will give an introduction to DBpedia for web developers and an overview of DBpedia's development over the last year. We will demonstrate how DBpedia URIs are used for document annotation and how Web applications can via DBpedia facilitate Wikipedia as a source of structured knowledge.},

We argue, that vocabularies, ontologies and knowledge bases should be accompanied by a number of test cases, which help to ensure a basic level of quality. We present a methodology for assessing the quality of linked data resources, based on a formalization of bad smells and data quality problems. Our formalization employs SPARQL query templates, which are instantiated into concrete quality test case queries. Based on an extensive survey, we compile a comprehensive library of data quality test case patterns. We perform automatic test case instantiation based on schema constraints or semi-automatically enriched schemata and allow the user to generate specific test case instantiations that are applicable to a schema or dataset. We provide an extensive evaluation of five LOD datasets, manual test case instantiation for five schemas and automatic test case instantiations for all available schemata registered with LOV. One of the main advantages of our approach is that domain specific semantics can be encoded in the data quality test cases, thus being able to discover data quality problems beyond conventional quality heuristics.},

@inproceedings{Kunze2013,
	abstract = {Recently, a large number of dataset repositories, catalogs and portals are emerging in the science and government realms. Once a large number of datasets are published on such data portals, the question arises how to retrieve datasets satisfying a user's information need. In this article, we present an approach for retrieving datasets according to user queries. We define \emph{dataset retrieval} as a specialization of information retrieval. Instead of retrieving documents that are relevant to a certain information need, dataset retrieval describes the process of returning relevant RDF datasets. As with information retrieval, the term \emph{relevance} cannot be clearly defined when using traditional methods like stemming. The inherent usage of RDF in RDF datasets enables a better way of retrieving relevant ones. We therefore propose an additional retrieval mechanism, which is inspired by facet search: \emph{dataset filtering}. When querying, the entire set of available datasets is processed by a set of \emph{semantic filters} each of which can unambiguously decide whether or not a given dataset is relevant to the query. The resulting set is then given back to the requester. We implemented and evaluated our approach in CKAN, which fuels publicdata.eu and is the most popular data portal worldwide.},

In this demo we present the CubeViz visualization architecture and components, sketch its underlying API and the libraries used to generate the desired output. By employing advanced introspection, analysis and visualization bootstrapping techniques CubeViz hides the schema complexity of the encoded data in order to support a user-friendly exploration experience.},

However, certain categories of semantically enriched content, such as multimodal documents as well as multilingual textual resources are still difficult to handle. In this paper, we present a comprehensive strategy for managing the life-cycle of both multimodal and multilingual semantically enriched content. The strategy is based on extending a number of semantic knowledge management techniques such as authoring, versioning, evolution, access and exploration for semantically enriched multimodal and multilingual content. We showcase an implementation and user interface based on the semantic wiki paradigm and present a use case from the e-tourism domain.},

The objective of the survey was to involve as many relevant stakeholders as possible in the 27 European Union countries in an online questionnaire and ask them about their needs and requirements in the area of open data as well as for the publicdata.eu portal. The main areas of the survey have been questions about Open Government Data itself, questions about data, about the usage of data, questions about the requirements for a centralised data catalogue as well as questions about the participants themselves. The goal of the OGD Stakeholder Survey has been to reach a broad audience of the main stakeholders of open data: citizens, public administration, politics and industry. In the course of the survey that was open for 5 weeks from November 2010 to December 2010 in total 329 participants completed the survey. The results have been published in April 2011 in the form of HTML and PDF, the raw data in CSV. In addition to these publication formats (HTML, PDF, CSV) we published the data also as Linked Data using various vocabularies and tools.},

@techreport{martin-scoreboard,
	abstract = {Evidence-based policy is policy informed by rigorously established objective evidence. An important aspect of evidence-based policy is the use of scientifically rigorous studies to identify programs and practices capable of improving policy relevant outcomes. Statistics represent a crucial means to determine whether progress is made towards policy targets. In May 2010, the European Commission adopted the Digital Agenda for Europe, a strategy to take advantage of the potential offered by the rapid progress of digital technologies. The Digital Agenda contains commitments to undertake a number of specific policy actions intended to stimulate a circle of investment in and usage of digital technologies. It identifies 13 key performance targets. In order to chart the progress of both the announced policy actions and the key performance targets a scoreboard is published, thus allowing the monitoring and benchmarking of the main developments of information society in European countries. In addition to these human-readable browsing, visualization and exploration methods, machine-readable access facilitating re-usage and interlinking of the underlying data is provided by means of RDF and Linked Open Data. We sketch the transformation process from raw data up to rich, interlinked RDF, describe its publishing and the lessons learned.},

@inproceedings{Marx2013,
	abstract = {In the last years an increasing number of structured data was published on the Web as Linked Open Data (LOD). Despite recent advances, consuming and using Linked Open Data within an organization is still a substantial challenge. Many of the LOD datasets are quite large and despite progress in RDF data management their loading and querying within a triple store is extremely time-consuming and resource-demanding. To overcome this consumption obstacle, we propose a process inspired by the classical Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) paradigm. In this article, we focus particularly on the selection and extraction steps of this process. We devise a fragment of SPARQL dubbed SliceSPARQL, which enables the selection of well-defined slices of datasets fulfilling typical information needs. SliceSPARQL supports graph patterns for which each connected subgraph pattern involves a maximum of one variable or IRI in its join conditions. This restriction guarantees the efficient processing of the query against a sequential dataset dump stream. As a result our evaluation shows that dataset slices can be generated an order of magnitude faster than by using the conventional approach of loading the whole dataset into a triple store and retrieving the slice by executing the query against the triple store's SPARQL endpoint.},

@inproceedings{dbtrends2016,
	abstract = {Providing accurate approaches for keyword search or question answering to access the data available on the Linked Data Web is of central importance to ensure that it can be used by non-experts. In many cases, these approaches return a large number of results that need to be provided in the right order so as to be of relevance to the user. Achieving the goal of improving the access to the Linked Data Web thus demands the provision of ranking approaches that allow sorting potentially large number of results appropriately. While such functions have been designed in previous works, they have not been evaluated exhaustively. This work addresses this research gap by proposing a formal framework designed towards comparing and evaluating different ranking functions for RDF data. The framework allows combining these rankings by means of an extension of the Spearman's footrule estimation of the upper bound of this function. We supply a benchmark with a total of 60 manually annotated entity ranks by users from USA and India recruited over Amazon Mechanical Turk. Moreover, we evaluated nine entity ranking functions over the proposed benchmark.},

@article{dbpedia_live_2012,
	abstract = {Purpose - DBpedia extracts structured information from Wikipedia, interlinks it with other knowledge bases and freely publishes the results on the Web using Linked Data and SPARQL. However, the DBpedia release process is heavy-weight and releases are sometimes based on several months old data. DBpedia-Live solves this problem by providing a live synchronization method based on the update stream of Wikipedia. Design/methodology/approach - Wikipedia provides DBpedia with a continuous stream of updates, i.e. a stream of recently updated articles. DBpedia-Live processes that stream on the fly to obtain RDF data and stores the extracted data back to DBpedia. DBpedia-Live publishes the newly added/deleted triples in files, in order to enable synchronization between our DBpedia endpoint and other DBpedia mirrors. Findings - During the realization of DBpedia-Live we learned, that it is crucial to process Wikipedia updates in a priority queue. Recently-updated Wikipedia articles should have the highest priority, over mapping-changes and unmodified pages. An overall finding is that there is a plenty of opportunities arising from the emerging Web of Data for librarians. Practical implications - DBpedia had and has a great effect on the Web of Data and became a crystallization point for it. Many companies and researchers use DBpedia and its public services to improve their applications and research approaches. The DBpedia-Live framework improves DBpedia further by timely synchronizing it with Wikipedia, which is relevant for many use cases requiring up-to-date information. Originality/value - The new DBpedia-Live framework adds new features to the old DBpedia-Live framework, e.g. abstract extraction, ontology changes, and changesets publication.},

	abstract = {Links build the backbone of the Linked Data Cloud. With the steady growth in size of datasets comes an increased need for end users to know which frameworks to use for deriving links between datasets. In this survey, we comparatively evaluate current Link Discovery tools and frameworks. For this purpose, we outline general requirements and derive a generic architecture of Link Discovery frameworks. Based on this generic architecture, we study and compare the features of state-ofthe-art linking frameworks. We also analyze reported performance evaluations for the different frameworks. Finally, we derive insights pertaining to possible future developments in the domain of Link Discovery.},

	abstract = {Presently, an amount of publications in Machine Learning and Data Mining contexts are contributing to the improvement of algorithms and methods in their respective fields. However, with regard to publication and sharing of scientific experiment achievements, we still face problems on searching and ranking these methods. Scouring the Internet to search state-of-the-art information about specific contexts, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), is often a time-consuming task. Besides, this process can lead to an incomplete investigation, either because search engines may return incomplete information or keywords may not be properly defined. To bridge this gap, we present WASOTA, a web portal specifically designed to share and readily present metadata about the state of the art on a specific domains, making the process of searching this information easier.},

	abstract = {The Linked Data Web has developed into a compendium of partly very large datasets. Devising efficient approaches to compute links between these datasets is thus central to achieve the vision behind the Data Web. Several unsupervised approaches have been developed to achieve this goal. Yet, so far, none of these approaches makes use of the replication of resources across several knowledge bases to improve the accuracy it achieves while linking. In this paper, we present Colibri, an iterative unsupervised approach for link discovery. Colibri allows discovering links between n datasets (n ≥ 2) while improving the quality of the instance data in these datasets. To this end, Colibri combines error detection and correction with unsupervised link discovery. We evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets with respect to the F-score itachieves. Our results suggest that Colibri can significantly improve the results of unsupervised machine-learning approaches for link discovery while correctly detecting erroneous resources.},

Therefore the creation, management, curation and publication of Linked Data are critical aspects for an application's success. For all of these aspects the LOD2 project provides components.

We will show how to get access; which component covers which aspect of the Linked Data life cycle and how using the stack eases the access to Linked Data management tools. Furthermore we will elaborate how the stack can be used to support a knowledge domain. The illustrated domain is statistical data.},

	abstract = {Supply Chain Management aims at optimizing the flow of goods and services from the producer to the consumer. Closely interconnected enterprises that align their production, logistics and procurement with one another thus enjoy a competitive advantage in the market. To achieve a close alignment, an instant, robust and efficient information flow along the supply chain between and within enterprises is required. However, less efficient human communication is often used instead of automatic systems because of the great diversity of enterprise systems and models. This paper describes an approach and its implementation SCM Intelligence App, which enables the configuration of individual supply chains together with the execution of industry accepted performance metrics. Based on machine-processable supply chain data model (the SCORVoc RDF vocabulary implementing the SCOR standard) and W3C standardized protocols such as SPARQL, the approach represents an alternative to closed software systems, which lack support for inter-organizational supply chain analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach using a prototypical implementation and a test scenario.},

@inproceedings{wi_farming_nepal,
	abstract = {It is widely accepted that food supply and quality are major problems in the 21st century. Due to the growth of the world's population, there is a pressing need to improve the productivity of agricultural crops, which hinges on different factors such as geographical location, soil type, weather condition and particular attributes of the crops to plant. In many regions of the world, information about those factors is not readily accessible and dispersed across a multitude of different sources. One of those regions is Nepal, in which the lack of access to this knowledge poses a significant burden for agricultural planning and decision making. Making such knowledge more accessible can boot up a farmer's living standard and increase their competitiveness on national and global markets. In this article, we show how we converted several available, although not easily accessible, datasets to RDF, thereby lowering the barrier for data re-usage and integration. We describe the conversion, linking, and publication process as well as use cases, which can be implemented using the farming datasets in Nepal.},

It can be easily extended and specialized and it is also mapped to other more domain-specific ontologies developed in the area of machine learning and data mining. In this paper we overview existing state-of-the-art machine learning interchange formats and present the first release of ML-Schema, a canonical format resulted of more than seven years of experience among different research institutions. We argue that exposing semantics of machine learning algorithms, models, and experiments through a canonical format may pave the way to better interpretability and to realistically achieve the full interoperability of experiments regardless of platform or adopted workflow solution.},

But, these efforts can be reduced by a data management workflow framework. We present the Linked Data Workflow Project ontology as the knowledge model for such a workflow framework. The ontology is centered on the Plan, Method, and Execution classes, facilitating the description of: i) the methodological process that guides the lifecycle of RDF datasets, ii) the complete plan of the RDF dataset production workflow, and iii) the executions of workflow. As a result, our approach enables the reproducibility and repeatability of Linked Data processing steps over time.},

The cost for producing Linked Data can be reduced by a workflow management system, which describes plans to systematically support the lifecycle of RDF datasets. We present the LODFlow Linked Data Workflow Management System, which provides an environment for planning, executing, reusing, and documenting Linked Data workflows. The LODFlow approach is based on a comprehensive knowledge model for describing the workflows and a workflow execution engine supporting systematic workflow execution, reporting, and exception handling. The environment was evaluated in a large-scale real-world use case. As result, LODFlow supports Linked Data engineers to systematically plan, execute and assess Linked Data production and maintenance workflows, thus improving efficiency, ease-of-use, reproducibility, reuseability and provenance.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The paper presents a proposal for the Heloise Common Research Model (HCRM), to be implemented for the European research network on digital academic history -- Heloise. The objective of Heloise is to interlink databases and other digital resources stemming from several research projects in the field of academic history, to provide an integrated database for federated research on the network databases. The HCRM defines three layers: the Repository Layer, the Application Layer and the Research Interface Layer, which are presented in detail. As part of the application and research interface layer, essential concepts are the symogih.org ontology and a Heloise network-specific thesaurus. The concepts have been tested on a sample of Heloise network's datasets as a part of a prototype of the envisaged platform that the authors have started implementing. The paper concludes with future developments to be accomplished within the Heloise network.Keywords: academic history, domain ontologies, data interoperability, semantic web technologies, linked open data.Investigaci{\'o}n colaborativa sobre la historia acad{\'e}mica a trav{\'e}s de los datos abiertos enlazados: una propuesta para el modelo de investigaci{\'o}n com{\'u}n de H{\'e}lo{\"\i}se Resumen: El art{\'\i}culo presenta una propuesta para el modelo de investigaci{\'o}n com{\'u}n de H{\'e}lo{\"\i}se (HCRM en sus siglas en ingl{\'e}s) para su implementaci{\'o}n por la red de investigaci{\'o}n europea sobre la historia acad{\'e}mica digital -- H{\'e}lo{\"\i}se.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a query abstraction mechanism which allows web/mobile-service administrator to formulate a skeleton of a sequence of SQL queries by parameterizing holes, later being filled by end-users. The mechanism is generic as the administrator can use it to register multiple services, and expandable as the existing service can be specialized, to automatically generate new kinds of personalized services. An end-user's input, when given in its entirety, initiates the automatic generation of appropriate SQL queries suitable for the user's requested service. A personalized service can be devised by designating the enduser's input parameters into static or dynamic. When static input arguments are given, a specialized skeleton service with respect to the given input is created. The mechanism is implemented to be used in systems for web/mobile-based information and transaction services.},

	abstract = {The volume of unstructured information presented on the Internet is constantly increasing, together with the total amount of websites and their contents. To process this vast amount of information it is important to distinguish different clusters of related webpages. Such clusters are used, for example, for knowledge extraction, named entity recognition, and recommendation algorithms. A variety of applications (such as semantic analysis systems, crawlers and search engines) utilizes semantic clustering algorithms to recognize thematically connected webpages. The majority of them relies on text analysis of the web documents content, and this leads to certain limitations, such as long processing time, need of representative text content, or vagueness of natural language. In this article, we present an framework for unsupervised domain and language independent semantic clustering of the website, which utilizes its internal hypertext structure and does not require text analysis. As a basis, we represent the hypertext structure as a graph and apply known flow simulation clustering algorithms to the graph to produce a set of webpage clusters. We assume these clusters contain thematically connected webpages. We evaluate our clustering approach with a corpus of real-world webpages and compare the approach with well-known text document clustering algorithms.},

@inproceedings{sejdiu-2018-dist-lod-stats-iswc,
	abstract = {Over the last years, the Semantic Web has been growing steadily. Today, we count more than 10,000 datasets made available online following Semantic Web standards.
Nevertheless, many applications, such as data integration, search, and interlinking, may not take the full advantage of the data without having a priori statistical information about its internal structure and coverage.
In fact, there are already a number of tools, which offer such statistics, providing basic information about RDF datasets and vocabularies.
However, those usually show severe deficiencies in terms of performance once the dataset size grows beyond the capabilities of a single machine.
In this paper, we introduce a software component for statistical calculations of large RDF datasets, which scales out to clusters of machines.
More specifically, we describe the first distributed in-memory approach for computing 32 different statistical criteria for RDF datasets using Apache Spark.
The preliminary results show that our distributed approach improves upon a previous centralized approach we compare against and provides approximately linear horizontal scale-up.
The criteria are extensible beyond the 32 default criteria, is integrated into the larger SANSA framework and employed in at least four major usage scenarios beyond the SANSA community.},

Query expansion methods augment the original query of a user with alternative query elements with similar meaning to increase the chance of retrieving appropriate resources. In this work, we introduce a number of new query expansion features based on semantic and linguistic inferencing over Linked Open Data. We evaluate the effectiveness of each feature individually as well as their combinations employing several machine learning approaches. The evaluation is carried out on a training dataset extracted from the QALD Question Answering benchmark. Furthermore, we propose an optimized linear combination of linguistic and lightweight semantic features in order to predict the usefulness of each expansion candidate.

@phdthesis{Sherif-thesis-2016,
	abstract = {Over the last years, the Linked Open Data (LOD) has evolved from a mere 12 to more than 10, 000 knowledge bases. These knowledge bases come from diverse domains including (but not limited to) publications, life sciences, social networking, government, media, linguistics. Moreover, the LOD cloud also contains a large number of crossdomain knowledge bases such as DBpedia and Yago2. These knowledge bases are commonly managed in a decentralized fashion and contain partly overlapping information. This architectural choice has led to knowledge pertaining to the same domain being published by independent entities in the LOD cloud. For example, information on drugs can be found in Diseasome as well as DBpedia and Drugbank. Furthermore, certain knowledge bases such as DBLP have been published by several bodies, which in turn has lead to duplicated content in the LOD. In addition, large amounts of geo-spatial information have been made available with the growth of heterogeneous Web of Data.
The concurrent publication of knowledge bases containing related information promises to become a phenomenon of increasing importance with the growth of the number of independent data providers. Enabling the joint use of the knowledge bases published by these providers for tasks such as federated queries, cross-ontology question answering and data integration is most commonly tackled by creating links between the resources described within these knowledge bases. Within this thesis, we spur the transition from isolated knowledge bases to enriched Linked Data sets where information can be easily integrated and processed. To achieve this goal, we provide concepts, approaches and use cases that facilitate the integration and enrichment of information with other data types that are already present on the Linked Data Web with a focus on geo-spatial data.
The first challenge that motivates our work is the lack of measures that use the geographic data for linking geo-spatial knowledge bases. This is partly due to the geo-spatial resources being described by the means of vector geometry. In particular, discrepancies in granularity and error measurements across knowledge bases render the selection of appropriate distance measures for geo-spatial resources difficult. We address this challenge by evaluating existing literature for pointset measures that can be used to measure the similarity of vector geometries. Then, we present and evaluate the ten measures that we derived from the literature on samples of three real knowledge bases.
The second challenge we address in this thesis is the lack of automatic Link Discovery (LD) approaches capable of dealing with geospatial knowledge bases with missing and erroneous data. To this end,we present Colibri, an unsupervised approach that allows discovering links between knowledge bases while improving the quality of the instance data in these knowledge bases. A Colibri iteration
begins by generating links between knowledge bases. Then, the approach makes use of these links to detect resources with probably erroneous or missing information. This erroneous or missing infor-
mation detected by the approach is finally corrected or added.
The third challenge we address is the lack of scalable LD approaches for tackling big geo-spatial knowledge bases. Thus, we present Deterministic Particle-Swarm Optimization (DPSO), a novel load balancing technique for LD on parallel hardware based on particle-swarm optimization. We combine this approach with the Orchid algorithm for geo-spatial linking and evaluate it on real and artificial data sets. The lack of approaches for automatic updating of links of an evolving knowledge base is our fourth challenge. This challenge is addressed in this thesis by the Wombat algorithm. Wombat is a novel approach for the discovery of links between knowledge bases that relies exclusively on positive examples. Wombat is based on generalisation via an upward refinement operator to traverse the space of Link Specifications (LS). We study the theoretical characteristics of Wombat and evaluate it on different benchmark data sets.
The last challenge addressed herein is the lack of automatic approaches for geo-spatial knowledge base enrichment. Thus, we propose Deer, a supervised learning approach based on a refinement operator for enriching Resource Description Framework (RDF) data sets. We show how we can use exemplary descriptions of enriched resources to generate accurate enrichment pipelines. We evaluate our approach against manually defined enrichment pipelines and show that our approach can learn accurate pipelines even when provided with a small number of training examples.
Each of the proposed approaches is implemented and evaluated against state-of-the-art approaches on real and/or artificial data sets. Moreover, all approaches are peer-reviewed and published in a con-
ference or a journal paper. Throughout this thesis, we detail the ideas, implementation and the evaluation of each of the approaches. Moreover, we discuss each approach and present lessons learned. Finally, we conclude this thesis by presenting a set of possible future extensions and use cases for each of the proposed approaches.},

Moreover, while some distance measures are significantly slower than other measures, distance measure based on means, surjections and sums of minimal distances are robust against the different types of discrepancies.},

@inproceedings{defactorest,
	abstract = {The curation of a knowledge base is a key task for ensuring the correctness and traceability of the knowledge provided in the said knowledge. This task is often carried out manually by human curators, who attempt to provide reliable facts and their respective sources in a three-step process: issuing appropriate keyword queries for the fact to check using standard search engines, retrieving potentially relevant documents and screening those documents for relevant content. However, this process is very time-consuming, mainly due to the human curators having to scrutinize the web pages retrieved by search engines. This demo paper demonstrate the RESTful implementation for DeFacto (Deep Fact Validation) -- an approach able to validate facts in RDF by finding trustworthy sources for them on the Web. DeFacto aims to support the validation of facts by supplying the user with (1) relevant excerpts of web pages as well as (2) useful additional information including (3) a score for the confidence DeFacto has in the correctness of the input fact. To achieve this goal, DeFacto collects and combines evidence from web pages written in several languages. We also provide an extension for finding similar resources obtained from the Linked Data, using the sameas.org service as backend. In addition, DeFacto provides support for facts with a temporal scope, i.e., it can estimate the time frame within which a fact was valid.},

	abstract = {The prime aspect of quality for search-driven web applications is to provide users with the best possible results for a given query. Thus, it is necessary to predict the relevance of results a priori. Current solutions mostly engage clicks on results for respective predictions, but research has shown that it is highly beneficial to also consider additional features of user interaction. Nowadays, such interactions are produced in steadily growing amounts by internet users. Processing these amounts calls for streaming-based approaches and incrementally updateable relevance models. We present StreamMyRelevance!--a novel streaming-based system for ensuring quality of ranking in search engines. Our approach provides a complete pipeline from collecting interactions in real-time to processing them incrementally on the server side. We conducted a large-scale evaluation with real-world data from the hotel search domain. Results show that our system yields predictions as good as those of competing state-of-the-art systems, but by design of the underlying framework at higher efficiency, robustness, and scalability.},

	abstract = {While several tools for simplifying the task of visualizing (SPARQL accessible) RDF data on the Web are available today, there is a lack of corresponding tools for exploiting standard HTML forms directly for RDF editing. The few related existing systems roughly fall in the categories of (a) applications that are not aimed at being reused as components, (b) form generators, which automatically create forms from a given schema -- possibly derived from instance data -- or (c) form template processors which create forms from a manually created specification. Furthermore, these systems usually come with their own widget library, which can only be extended by wrapping existing widgets. In this paper, we present the AngularJS-based \emph{Rdf Edit eXtension} (REX) system, which facilitates the enhancement of standard HTML forms as well as many existing AngularJS widgets with RDF editing support by means of a set of HTML attributes. We demonstrate our system though the realization of several usage scenarios.},

	abstract = {The combination of the advantages of widely used relational databases and semantic technologies has attracted significant research over the past decade. In particular, mapping languages for the conversion of databases to RDF knowledge bases have been developed and standardized in the form of R2RML. In this article, we first review those mapping languages and then devise work towards a unified formal model for them. Based on this, we present the Sparqlification Mapping Language (SML), which provides an intuitive way to declare mappings based on SQL VIEWS and SPARQL construct queries. We show that SML has the same expressivity as R2RML by enumerating the language features and show the correspondences, and we outline how one syntax can be converted into the other. A conducted user study for this paper juxtaposing SML and R2RML provides evidence that SML is a more compact syntax which is easier to understand and read and thus lowers the barrier to offer SPARQL access to relational databases.},

	abstract = {Advantages and disadvantages of a learning assessment based on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are a long and widely discussed issue in the scientific community. However, in practice this type of questions is very popular due to the possibility of automatic evaluation and scoring. Consequently, an important research question is to exploiting the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of MCQs. In this work we discuss one particularly important issue of MCQs, namely methods for scoring results in the case, when the MCQ has several correct alternatives (multiple-mark questions, MMQs). We propose a general approach and mathematical model to score MMQs, that aims at recognizing guessing while at the same time resulting in a balanced score. In our approach conventional MCQs are viewed as a particular case of multiple-mark questions, thus, the formulas can be applied to tests mixing MCQs and MMQs. The rational of our approach is that scoring should be based on the guessing level of the question. Our approach can be added as an option, or even as a replacement for manual penalization. We show that our scoring method outperforms existing methods and demonstrate that with synthetic and real experiments.},

	abstract = {The support of multilingual content becomes crucial for educational platforms due to the benefits it offers. In this paper we propose a concept that allows content authors to use the power of the crowd to create (semantically) structured multilingual educational content out of their material. To enable the collaboration of the crowd, we expand our previously developed CrowdLearn concept and WikiApp data model to support multilingual educational content. The expanded concept, CoSMEC, was evaluated with an example implementation within the web-based educational platform SlideWiki. Based on this experience, we provide solutions for the most complicated technical issues we faced during the implementation. This paper also discusses statistics which show the flow of multilingual content usage.},

	abstract = {A special activity, that became possible nowadays, is the collaborative e-learning and collaborative engineering of learning materials. Such an opportunity is available in educational systems, based on the wiki paradigm. However, Ward Cunningham's wiki paradigm was mainly only applied to unstructured, textual content thus limiting the content structuring, re-purposing and reuse. Some steps in this direction are made by Semantic Web technologies and their combination with the wiki paradigm. In many potential usage scenarios, however, the(semi-)structured educational content (e.g. presentations, questionnaires, diagrams, etc.) should be managed and the collaboration of large user communities around such content should be effectively facilitated. We present the CrowdLearn concept for collaborative engineering of the semantically structured learning objects as well as a model-driven approach to generate the wiki-like application operating in the spirit of CrowdLearn. We implement and evaluate the approach with Slidewiki - an educational platform mainly dealing with slide presentations. The article also comprises a usability evaluation with real students.},

@inproceedings{tarasowa-2013-csedu,
	abstract = {While there is meanwhile a plethora of Learning Content Management Systems, the collaborative, community- based creation of rich e-learning content is still not sufficiently well supported. There have been some efforts to apply the Ward Cunningham's wiki paradigm to the creation of e-learning content. However, the paradigm was mainly only applied to unstructured, textual content and can not be used in SCORM-compliant systems. To address the issue we develop the CrowdLearn concept to exploit the wisdom, creativity and productivity of the crowd for the creation of rich, deep-semantically structured e-learning content. The CrowdLearn con- cept combines the wiki style for collaborative content authoring with SCORM requirements for re-usability. Therefore, it enables splitting the learning material into Learning Objects (LOs) with an adjustable level of granularity. In order to realize the CrowdLearn concept, a novel data model called WikiApp is devised. The WikiApp data model is a refinement of the traditional entity-relationship data model with further emphasis on collaborative social activities and structured content authoring. We implement and evaluate the CrowdLearn approach with SlideWiki---an educational platform dealing with presentations and questionnaires. The article also comprises results of a usability evaluation with real students.},

	abstract = {Online social networking has become one of the most popular services on the Web. Especially Facebook with its 845Mio+ monthly active users and 100Mrd+ friendship relations creates a Web inside the Web. Drawing on the metaphor of islands, Facebook is becoming more like a continent. However, users are locked up on this continent with hardly any opportunity to communicate easily with users on other islands and continents or even to relocate trans-continentally. In addition to that, privacy, data ownership and freedom of communication issues are problematically in centralized environments. The idea of distributed social networking enables users to overcome the drawbacks of centralized social networks. The goal of this thesis is to provide an architecture for distributed social networking based on semantic technologies. This architecture consists of semantic artifacts, protocols and services which enable social network applications to work in a distributed environment and with semantic interoperability. Furthermore, this thesis presents applications for distributed semantic social networking and discusses user interfaces, architecture and communication strategies for this application category.},

	abstract = {Smartphones, which contain a large number of sensors and integrated devices, are becoming increasingly powerful and fully featured computing platforms in our pockets. For many people they already replace the computer as their window to the Internet, to the Web as well as to social networks. Hence, the management and presentation of information about contacts, social relationships and associated information is one of the main requirements and features of today's smartphones. The problem is currently solved only for centralized proprietary platforms (such as Google mail, contacts \& calendar) as well as data-silo-like social networks (e.g. Facebook). Within the Semantic Web initiative standards and best-practices for social, Semantic Web applications such as FOAF emerged. However, there is no comprehensive strategy, how these technologies can be used efficiently in a mobile environment. In this paper we present the architecture as well as the implementation of a mobile Social Semantic Web framework, which weaves a distributed social network based on semantic technologies.},

With this heterogeneity of identifiers it is complicated for users and agents to find the unique identifier which should be preferably used. We are introducing the concept of DBpedia Unique Identifier (DUI) and a dataset of linksets relating URIs to DUIs. In order to improve the quality of our dataset we developed a mechanism that allows the user to rate and suggest links. As proof of concept an implementation with a graphical web user interface is provided for accessing the linkset and rating the links.

	abstract = {The improvement of public health is one of the main indicators for societal progress. Statistical data for monitoring public health is highly relevant for a number of sectors, such as research (e.g. in the life sciences or economy), policy making, health care, pharmaceutical industry, insurances etc. Such data is meanwhile available even on a global scale, e.g. in the Global Health Observatory (GHO) of the United Nations's World Health Organization (WHO). GHO comprises more than 50 different datasets, it covers all 198 WHO member countries and is updated as more recent or revised data becomes available or when there are changes to the methodology being used. However, this data is only accessible via complex spreadsheets and, therefore, queries over the 50 different datasets as well as combinations with other datasets are very tedious and require a significant amount of manual work. By making the data available as RDF, we lower the barrier for data re-use and integration. In this article, we describe the conversion and publication process as well as use cases, which can be implemented using the GHO data.},

	abstract = {Cognition is determined by function and interplay of several hundred if not thousand genes with a considerable overlap in the phenotypes and genes causing different cognitive diseases. We argue that these diseases should not be studied in isolation, but that data allowing to study them should be integrated. Ultimately, this will allow researchers to more easily answer questions, which would otherwise require time-consuming research. Specifically, we propose to use Linked Data publication, data integration and querying methods, which has been successfully used in other life science domains. In this initial effort, we converted 12 different datasets, integrate them and provide a first demonstration of the added value by showing how a set of relevant queries over the integrated data can be answered.},

In this work, we consider social media as a supplementary source of knowledge in addition to historical environmental data. Further, we build a joint model that learns from disaster-related tweets and environmental data to improve prediction.
We propose the combination of semantically-enriched word embedding to represent entities in tweets with their semantics representations computed with the traditional word2vec. Our experiments show that our proposed approach outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art models in disaster prediction.},

@inproceedings{PhoneticSimilarity2019,
	abstract = {An increasing number of heterogeneous datasets abiding by the
Linked Data paradigm is published everyday. Discovering links
between these datasets is thus central to achieving the vision behind the Data Web. Declarative Link Discovery (LD) frameworks
rely on complex Link Specification (LS) to express the conditions
under which two resources should be linked. Complex LS combine similarity measures with thresholds to determine whether
a given predicate holds between two resources. State of the art
LD frameworks rely mostly on string-based similarity measures
such as Levenshtein and Jaccard. However, string-based similarity measures often fail to catch the similarity of resources with
phonetically similar property values when these property values
are represented using different string representation (e.g., names
and street labels). In this paper, we evaluate the impact of using
phonetics-based similarities in the process of LD.
Moreover, we evaluate the impact of phonetic-based similarity
measures on a state-of-the-art machine learning approach used
to generate LS. Our experiments suggest that the combination
of string-based and phonetic-based measures can improve the Fmeasures achieved by LD frameworks on most datasets.},

@inproceedings{gusmita2019quant,
	abstract = {Question answering engines have become one of the most popular type of applications driven by Semantic Web technologies. Consequently, the provision of means to quantify the performance of current question answering approaches on current datasets has become ever more important. However, a large percentage of the queries found in popular question answering benchmarks cannot be executed on current versions of their reference dataset. There is a consequently a clear need to curate question answering benchmarks periodically. However, the manual  alteration of question answering benchmarks is often error-prone. We alleviate this problem by presenting QUANT, a novel framework for the creation and curation of question answering benchmarks. QUANT supports the curation of benchmarks by generating smart edit suggestions for question-query pair and for the corresponding metadata. In addition, our framework supports the creation of new benchmark entries by providing predefined quality checks for queries. We evaluate QUANT on 653 questions obtained from QALD-1 to QALD-8 with 10 users. Our results show that our framework generates reliable suggestions and can reduce the curation effort for QA benchmarks by up to 91%.},

@inproceedings{khanISWC2019,
	abstract = {Over years, the Web of Data has grown significantly. Various interfaces such as SPARQL endpoints, data dumps, and Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF) have been proposed to provide access to this data. Studies show that many of the SPARQL endpoints have availability issues. The data dumps do not provide live querying capabilities. The TPF solution aims to provide a trade-off between the availability and performance by dividing the workload among TPF servers and clients. In this solution, the TPF server only performs the triple patterns execution of the given SPARQL query. While the TPF client performs the joins between the triple patterns to compute the final resultset  of the SPARQL query. High availability is achieved in TPF but increase in network bandwidth and query execution time lower the performance. We want to propose a more intelligent SPARQL querying server to keep the high availability along with high query execution performance, while minimizing the network bandwidth. The proposed server will offer query execution services (can be single triple patterns or even join execution) according to the current status of the workload. If a server is free, it should be able to execute the complete SPARQL query. Thus, the server will offer execution services while avoiding going beyond the maximum query processing limit, i.e. the point after which the performance start decreasing or even service shutdown. Furthermore, we want to develop a more intelligent client, which keeps track of a server's processing capabilities and therefore avoid DOS attacks and crashes.},

@inproceedings{syed2019copaal,
	abstract = {Any data publisher can make RDF knowledge graphs available for consumption on the Web. This is a direct consequence of the decentralized publishing paradigm underlying the Data Web, which has led to more than 150 billion facts on more than 3 billion things being published on the Web in more than 10,000 RDF knowledge graphs over the last decade. However, the success of this publishing paradigm also means that the validation of the facts contained in RDF knowledge graphs has become more important than ever before. Several families of fact validation algorithms have been developed over the last years to address several settings of the fact validation problems. In this paper, we consider the following fact validation setting: Given an RDF knowledge graph, compute the likelihood that a given (novel) fact is true. None of the current solutions to this problem exploits RDFS semantics---especially domain, range and class subsumption information. We address this research gap by presenting an unsupervised approach dubbed COPAAL, that extracts paths from knowledge graphs to corroborate (novel) input facts. Our approach relies on a mutual information measure that takes the RDFS semantics underlying the knowledge graph into consideration. In particular, we use the information shared by predicates and paths within the knowledge graph to compute the likelihood of a fact being corroborated by the knowledge graph. We evaluate our approach extensively using 17 publicly available datasets. Our results indicate that our approach outperforms the state of the art unsupervised approaches significantly by up to 0.15 AUC-ROC. We even outperform supervised approaches by up to 0.07 AUC-ROC. The source code of COPAAL is open-source and is available at https://github.com/dice-group/COPAAL.},

	abstract = {Knowledge graph embedding methods learn continuous vector representations for entities in knowledge graphs and have been used successfully in a large number of applications. We present a novel and scalable paradigm for the computation of knowledge graph embeddings, which we dub Pyke. Our approach combines a physical model based on Hooke's law and its inverse with ideas from simulated annealing to compute embeddings for knowledge graphs efficiently. We prove that Pyke achieves a linear space complexity. While the time complexity for the initialization of our approach is quadratic, the time complexity of each of its iterations is linear in the size of the input knowledge graph. Hence, Pyke's overall runtime is close to linear. Consequently, our approach easily scales up to knowledge graphs containing millions of triples. We evaluate our approach against six state-of-the-art embedding approaches on the DrugBank and DBpedia datasets in two series of experiments. The first series shows that the cluster purity achieved by Pyke is up to 26{\%} (absolute) better than that of the state of art. In addition, Pyke is more than 22 times faster than existing embedding solutions in the best case. The results of our second series of experiments show that Pyke is up to 23{\%} (absolute) better than the state of art on the task of type prediction while maintaining its superior scalability. Our implementation and results are open-source and are available at http://github.com/dice-group/PYKE.},

@article{JWS2020_Facete,
	abstract = {In this work, we present a schema-agnostic faceted browsing benchmark generation framework for RDF data and SPARQL engines. Faceted search is a technique that allows narrowing down sets of information items by applying constraints over their properties, whereas facets correspond to properties of these items. While our work can be used to realise real-world faceted search user interfaces, our focus lies on the construction and benchmarking of faceted search queries over knowledge graphs. The RDF model exhibits several traits that seemingly make it a natural foundation for faceted search: all information items are represented as RDF resources, property values typically already correspond to meaningful semantic classifications, and with SPARQL there is a standard language for uniformly querying instance and schema information. However, although faceted search is ubiquitous today, it is typically not performed on the RDF model directly. Two major sources of concern are the complexity of query generation and the query performance. To overcome the former, our framework comes with an intermediate domain-specific language. Thereby our approach is SPARQL-driven which means that every faceted search information need is intensionally expressed as a single SPARQL query. In regard to the latter, we investigate the possibilities and limits of real-time SPARQL-driven faceted search on contemporary triple stores. We report on our findings by evaluating systems performance and correctness characteristics when executing a benchmark generated using our generation framework. All components, namely the benchmark generator, the benchmark runners and the underlying faceted search framework, are published freely available as open source.},

@inproceedings{demir2021shallow,
	abstract = {Knowledge graph completion refers to predicting missing triples. Most approaches achieve this goal by predicting entities, given an entity and a relation. We predict missing triples via the relation prediction. To this end, we frame the relation prediction problem as a multi-label classification problem and propose a shallow neural model (SHALLOM) that accurately infers missing relations from entities. SHALLOM is analogous to C-BOW as both approaches predict a central token (p) given surrounding tokens ((s,o)). Our experiments indicate that SHALLOM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the FB15K-237 and WN18RR with margins of up to 3% and 8% (absolute), respectively,  while requiring a maximum training time of 8 minutes on these datasets. We ensure the reproducibility of our results by providing an open-source implementation including training and evaluation scripts.},

	abstract = {Metadata portals offer access to Open Data, which is increasingly published on the basis of RDF vocabularies and ontologies. Individual datasets include URIs and descriptions of licenses under which the datasets are published. Licenses can be defined by attributes of the types permission, requirement and prohibition. This paper focuses on the problem of relicensing datasets that include multiple other open datasets published under different licenses. If combined datasets are republished, a chosen license must comply with the original licenses of each dataset. The approach is based on mapping licenses to deontic interpretations and combining them using an OR-composite operator. The result of the operator is used to determine matching licenses from a Knowledge Base containing license information. The approach is evaluated based on the Creative Commons License Compatibility Chart.},

	abstract = {As chatbots are gaining popularity for simplifying access to information and community interaction, it is essential to examine whether these agents are serving their intended purpose and catering to the needs of their users. Therefore, we present an approach to perform an ex-post-facto analysis over the logs of knowledge base-driven dialogue systems. Using the DBpedia Chatbot as our case study, we inspect three aspects of the interactions, (i) user queries and feedback, (ii) the bot's response to these queries, and (iii) the overall flow of the conversations. We discuss key implications based on our findings. All the source code used for the analysis can be found at https://github.com/dice-group/DBpedia-Chatlog-Analysis.},

	abstract = {Besides the challenge that a human can ask one question in many different ways, a key aspect in Question Answering approaches over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) is to deal with the vast amount of information present in the knowledge graphs. Modern real-world knowledge graphs contain nearly millions of entities and relationships. Additionally, they are enriched with new facts every day. However, not all facts are relevant for answering particular questions, thus fostering several challenges to KGQA systems, which require interpretable and query-able data. One solution to filtering the extra data in knowledge graphs is to rely on graph summarization techniques. Graph-based summarization approaches aim to resize knowledge graphs to be more concise and precise by storing only relevant information. In this paper, we propose a framework named LAUREN that applies different summarization techniques on knowledge graphs to be used in KGQA systems. Our experiments show that LAUREN summarizes large knowledge graphs such as DBpedia by 2 million entities and its summarization still achieves the same performance on both question answering and linking tasks compared to the complete DBpedia.},

Recent studies highlight the need to filter information on social media into fine-grained content labels. However, identifying useful information from massive amounts of social media posts during a crisis is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose I-AID, a multimodel approach to automatically categorize tweets into multi-label information types and filter critical information from the enormous volume of social media data. I-AID incorporates three main components: i) a BERT- based encoder to capture the semantics of a tweet and represent as a low-dimensional vector, ii) a graph attention network (GAT) to apprehend correlations between tweets' words/entities and the corresponding information types, and iii) a Relation Network as a learnable distance metric to compute the similarity between tweets and their corresponding information types in a supervised way. We conducted several experiments on two real publicly-available datasets. Our results indicate that I-AID outperforms state-of- the-art approaches in terms of weighted average F1 score by +6% and +4% on the TREC-IS dataset and COVID-19 Tweets, respectively.},

@inproceedings{ASSET2021,
	abstract = {Entity typing in knowledge graphs (KGs) aims to infer missing types of entities and might be considered one of the most significant tasks of knowledge graph construction since type information is highly relevant for querying, quality assurance, and KG applications. While supervised learning approaches for entity typing have been proposed, they require large amounts of (manually) labeled data, which can be expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for KG entity typing that leverages semi-supervised learning from massive unlabeled data. Our approach follows a teacher-student paradigm that allows combining a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data to boost performance. We conduct several experiments on two benchmarking datasets (FB15k-ET and YAGO43k-ET). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving entity typing in KGs. Given type information for only 1% of entities, our approach ASSET predicts missing types with a F1-score of 0.47 and 0.64 on the datasets FB15k-ET and YAGO43k-ET, respectively, outperforming supervised baselines.},

Current approaches search for said metapaths in the discrete search space spanned by the input knowledge graph and make no use of continuous representations of knowledge graphs. We hypothesize that augmenting existing approaches with information from continuous knowledge graph representations has the potential to improve their performance. Our approach Esther searches for metapaths in compositional embedding spaces instead of the graph itself. By being able to explore longer metapaths, it can detect supplementary evidence for assertions being true that can be exploited by existing fact checking approaches. We evaluate Esther by combining it with 10 other approaches in an ensemble learning setting. Our results agree with our hypothesis and suggest that all other approaches can benefit from being combined with Esther by 20.65{\%} AUC-ROC on average.

	abstract = {The sheer size of modern knowledge graphs has led to increased attention being paid to the entity summarization task. Given a knowledge graph T and an entity e found therein, solutions to entity summarization select a subset of the triples from T which summarize e's concise bound description. Presently, the best performing approaches rely on sequence-to-sequence models to generate entity summaries and use little to none of the structure information of T during the summarization process. We hypothesize that this structure information can be exploited to compute better summaries. To verify our hypothesis, we propose GATES, a new entity summarization approach that combines topological information and knowledge graph embeddings to encode triples. The topological information is encoded by means of a Graph Attention Network. Furthermore, ensemble learning is applied to boost the performance of triple scoring. We evaluate GATES on the DBpedia and LMDB datasets from ESBM (version 1.2), as well as on the FACES datasets. Our results show that GATES outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on 4 of 6 configuration settings and reaches up to 0.574 F-measure. Pertaining to resulted summaries quality, GATES still underperforms the state of the arts as it obtains the highest score only on 1 of 6 configuration settings at 0.697 NDCG score. An open-source implementation of our approach and of the code necessary to rerun our experiments are available at https://github.com/dice-group/GATES.},

abstract = {Knowledge graphs are used by a growing number of applications to represent structured data. Hence, evaluating the veracity of assertions in knowledge graphs—dubbed fact checking—is currently a challenge of growing importance. However, manual fact checking is commonly impractical due to the sheer size of knowledge graphs. This article is a systematic survey of recent works on automatic fact checking with a focus on knowledge graphs. We present recent fact-checking approaches, the varied sources they use as background knowledge, and the features they rely upon. Finally, we draw conclusions pertaining to possible future research directions in fact checking knowledge graphs.},

abstract="Class expression learning in description logics has long been regarded as an iterative search problem in an infinite conceptual space. Each iteration of the search process invokes a reasoner and a heuristic function. The reasoner finds the instances of the current expression, and the heuristic function computes the information gain and decides on the next step to be taken. As the size of the background knowledge base grows, search-based approaches for class expression learning become prohibitively slow. Current neural class expression synthesis (NCES) approaches investigate the use of neural networks for class expression learning in the attributive language with complement (ALC). While they show significant improvements over search-based approaches in runtime and quality of the computed solutions, they rely on the availability of pretrained embeddings for the input knowledge base. Moreover, they are not applicable to ontologies in more expressive description logics. In this paper, we propose a novel NCES approach which extends the state of the art to the description logic ALCHIQ(D). Our extension, dubbed NCES2, comes with an improved training data generator and does not require pretrained embeddings for the input knowledge base as both the embedding model and the class expression synthesizer are trained jointly. Empirical results on benchmark datasets suggest that our approach inherits the scalability capability of current NCES instances with the additional advantage that it supports more complex learning problems. NCES2 achieves the highest performance overall when compared to search-based approaches and to its predecessor NCES. We provide our source code, datasets, and pretrained models at https://github.com/dice-group/NCES2"

  abstract   ="Recent analyses of real-world queries show that a prominent type of queries is that of conjunctive regular path queries. Despite the increasing popularity of this type of queries, only limited efforts have been invested in their efficient evaluation. Motivated by recent results on the efficiency of worst-case optimal multi-way join algorithms for the evaluation of conjunctive queries, we present a novel multi-way join algorithm for the efficient evaluation of conjunctive regular path queries. The hallmark of our algorithm is the evaluation of the regular path queries found in conjunctive regular path queries using multi-way joins. This enables the exploitation of regular path queries in the planning steps of the proposed algorithm, which is crucial for the algorithm's efficiency, as shown by the results of our detailed evaluation using the Wikidata-based benchmark WDBench. The results of this evaluation also show that our approach achieves a value of query mixes per hour that is 4.3 higher than the state of the art and that it outperforms all of the competing graph storage solutions in almost 70{\%} of the benchmark's queries.",

    abstract = "Relation Extraction (RE) is a task that identifies relationships between entities in a text, enabling the acquisition of relational facts and bridging the gap between natural language and structured knowledge. However, current RE models often rely on small datasets with low coverage of relation types, particularly when working with languages other than English.In this paper, we address the above issue and provide two new resources that enable the training and evaluation of multilingual RE systems. First, we present SRED$^{\textrm{FM}}$, an automatically annotated dataset covering 18 languages, 400 relation types, 13 entity types, totaling more than 40 million triplet instances. Second, we propose RED$^{\textrm{FM}}$, a smaller, human-revised dataset for seven languages that allows for the evaluation of multilingual RE systems. To demonstrate the utility of these novel datasets, we experiment with the first end-to-end multilingual RE model, mREBEL, that extracts triplets, including entity types, in multiple languages. We release our resources and model checkpoints at [\url{https://www.github.com/babelscape/rebel}](\url{https://www.github.com/babelscape/rebel})."

Initially employing polynomial functions to compute embeddings, we progress to more intricate representations using neural networks with varying layer complexities. We argue that employing functions for embedding computation enhances expressiveness and allows for more degrees of freedom, enabling operations such as composition, derivatives and primitive of entities representation. Additionally, we meticulously outline the step-by-step construction of our approach and provide code for reproducibility, thereby facilitating further exploration and application in the field.},

Previous research in knowledge graph embeddings has focused exclusively on Clifford algebras of a specific type, which do not include nilpotent base vectors—elements that square to zero. In this work, we introduce a novel approach by incorporating nilpotent base vectors with a nilpotency index of two, leading to a more general form of Clifford algebras named degenerate Clifford algebras. This generalization to degenerate Clifford algebras does allow for covering dual numbers and as such include translations and rotations models under the same generalization paradigm for the first time. We develop two models to determine the parameters that define the algebra: one using a greedy search and another predicting the parameters based on neural network embeddings of the input knowledge graph. Our evaluation on seven benchmark datasets demonstrates that this incorporation of nilpotent vectors enhances the quality of embeddings. Additionally, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of generalization, particularly regarding the mean reciprocal rank achieved on validation data. Finally, we show that even a simple greedy search can effective},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their effectiveness in low-resource languages remains underexplored, particularly in complex tasks such as end-to-end Entity Linking (EL), which requires both mention detection and disambiguation against a knowledge base (KB). In earlier work, we introduced IndEL — the first end-to-end EL benchmark dataset for the Indonesian language — covering both a general domain (news) and a specific domain (religious text from the Indonesian translation of the Quran), and evaluated four traditional end-to-end EL systems on this dataset. In this study, we propose ELEVATE-ID, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing LLM performance on end-to-end EL in Indonesian. The framework evaluates LLMs under both zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions, using multilingual and Indonesian monolingual models, with Wikidata as the target KB. Our experiments include performance benchmarking, generalization analysis across domains, and systematic error analysis. Results show that GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 achieve the highest accuracy in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, respectively. However, even fine-tuned GPT-3.5 underperforms compared to DBpedia Spotlight — the weakest of the traditional model baselines — in the general domain. Interestingly, GPT-3.5 outperforms Babelfy in the specific domain. Generalization analysis indicates that fine-tuned GPT-3.5 adapts more effectively to cross-domain and mixed-domain scenarios. Error analysis uncovers persistent challenges that hinder LLM performance: difficulties with non-complete mentions, acronym disambiguation, and full-name recognition in formal contexts. These issues point to limitations in mention boundary detection and contextual grounding. Indonesian-pretrained LLMs, Komodo and Merak, reveal core weaknesses: template leakage and entity hallucination, respectively—underscoring architectural and training limitations in low-resource end-to-end EL.11Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/dice-group/ELEVATE-ID.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT In recent years, there has been an increasing awareness of the importance of incorporating diversity into research projects, focusing on both how they are conducted and their content. Funding organizations have started to require that research applicants pay attention to inclusion and diversity by considering gender dimensions and other diversity factors in their project plans and ensuring gender equality during execution. Based on an extensive literature research and expert discussions on how to develop and implement diversity strategies in large collaborative research projects, we argue that there is a lack of practical advice in existing literature. Drawing from our own experiences in conceptualizing and implementing a Diversity Program across four universities in Germany, we propose a framework for effectively integrating diversity into collaborative research initiatives across various academic fields.},

	abstract	= {Learning continuous vector representations for knowledge graphs has significantly improved state-of-the-art performances in many challenging tasks. Yet, deep-learning-based models are only post-hoc and locally explainable. In contrast, learning Web Ontology Language (OWL) class expressions in Description Logics (DLs) is ante-hoc and globally explainable. However, state-of-the-art learners have two well-known limitations: scaling to large knowledge graphs and handling missing information. Here, we present a decision-tree-based learner (tDL) to learn Web Ontology Languages (OWLs) class expressions over large knowledge graphs, while imputing missing triples. Given positive and negative example individuals, tDL firstly constructs unique OWL expressions in SHOIN from concise bounded descriptions of individuals. Each OWL class expression is used as a feature in a binary classification problem to represent input individuals. Thereafter, tDL fits a CART decision tree to learn Boolean decision rules distinguishing positive examples from negative examples. A final OWL expression in SHOIN is built by traversing the built CART decision tree from the root node to leaf nodes for each positive example. By this, tDL can learn OWL class expressions without exploration, i.e., the number of queries to a knowledge graph is bounded by the number of input individuals. Our empirical results show that tDL outperforms the current state-of-the-art models across datasets. Importantly, our experiments over a large knowledge graph (DBpedia with 1.1 billion triples) show that tDL can effectively learn accurate OWL class expressions, while the state-of-the-art models fail to return any results. Finally, expressions learned by tDL can be seamlessly translated into natural language explanations using a pre-trained large language model and a DL verbalizer.}
