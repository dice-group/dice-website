## Research Interests

My primary focus is on Knowledge Graph Summarization, utilizing both extractive and abstractive approaches, as well as Natural Language Processing. Nevertheless, I am open to collaboration in the following areas:

- Tasks related to knowledge graph construction, such as information extraction (named entity recognition, entity linking)
- Knowledge graph reasoning tasks, including link prediction and missing triple prediction
- Link specification and verbalization
- Working with language models, such as few-shot learning and fine-tuning
