## Research Interest

I am mainly interested in:

* Data engineering, knowledge graph construction & ontology building
* Knowledge graph integration using machine learning & large language models  
* Novel data integration approaches for supporting  NLP tasks such as entity summarization & keyphrase extraction
* Large language model  for supporting data integration tasks and vice versa


## Reviewing
My limited free time is partly consumed by tasks such as reviewing, for instance,‚Äù

* <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/">Journal of web semantics</a>
* <a href="https://www.semantic-web-journal.net">Semantic Web Journal</a>
* <a href="https://i3mainz.github.io/GeoLD2024/">GeoLD 2024</a>
